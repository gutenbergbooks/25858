<p style=' font-size:1.2em;'>FOREWORD</p>
<div style='margin-top:1em'></div>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>BY JACK BINNS</span></p>
</div>

<p>Within a comparatively short time after this
volume is published the human voice will be
thrown across the Atlantic Ocean under conditions
that will lead immediately to the establishment
of permanent telephone communication with
Europe by means of radio.
</p>
<p>Under the circumstances therefore the various
uses of radio which are so aptly outlined in it
will give the reader an idea of the tremendous
strides that have been made in the art of communicating
without wires during the past few
months.
</p>
<p>Of these one of the most important, which by
the way is dealt with to a large extent in the
present volume, is that of running down crooks.
It must not be forgotten that criminals, and those
criminally intent are not slow to utilize the latest
developments of the genius of man, and radio
is useful to them also. However, the forces of
law and order inevitably prevail, and radio therefore
is going to be increasingly useful in our
general police work.
</p>
<p>Another important use, as outlined in this
volume, is in the detection of forest fires, and in
fact generally protecting forest areas in conjunction
with aircraft. With these two means hundreds
of thousands of acres can now be patrolled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
in a single day more efficiently than a few acres
were previously covered.
</p>
<p>Radio is an ideal boy&#8217;s hobby, but it is not
limited to youth. Nevertheless it offers a wonderful
scope for the unquenchable enthusiasm
that always accompanies the application of youthful
endeavor, and it is a fact that the majority
of the wonderful inventions and improvements
that have been made in radio have been produced
by young men.
</p>
<p>Since this book was written there has been
produced in this country the most powerful
vacuum tube in the world. In size it is small,
but in output it is capable of producing 100 kilowatts
of electrical power. Three such tubes will
cast the human voice across the Atlantic Ocean
under any conditions, and transmit across the
same vast space the world&#8217;s grandest music.
Ten of these tubes joined in parallel at any
of the giant transmitting wireless telegraph stations
would send telegraph code messages practically
around the world.

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>SPLINTERING GLASS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;You fellows want to be sure to come round to
my house to-night and listen in on the radio concert,&#8221;
said Bob Layton to a group of his chums,
as they were walking along the main street of
Clintonia one day in the early spring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be there with bells on,&#8221; replied Joe Atwood,
as he kicked a piece of ice from his path.
&#8220;Trust me not to overlook anything when it
comes to radio. I&#8217;m getting to be more and
more of a fan with every day that passes.
Mother insists that I talk of it in my sleep, but I
guess she&#8217;s only fooling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Count on yours truly too,&#8221; chimed in Herb
Fennington. &#8220;I got stirred up about radio a
little later than the rest of you fellows, but now
I&#8217;m making up for lost time. Slow but sure is
my motto.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Slow is right,&#8221; chaffed Jimmy Plummer.
&#8220;But what on earth are you sure of?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; replied Herb, as he deftly slipped
a bit of ice down Jimmy&#8217;s back, &#8220;that in a minute
you&#8217;ll be dancing about like a howling dervish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His prophecy was correct, for Jimmy both
howled and danced as he tried vainly to extricate
the icy fragment that was sliding down his spine.
His contortions were so ludicrous that the boys
broke into roars of laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great joke, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; snorted Jimmy, as he
bent nearly double. &#8220;If you had a heart you&#8217;d
lend a hand and get this out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s stand him on his head,&#8221; suggested Joe.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the only thing I can think of. Then it&#8217;ll
slide out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hands were outstretched in ready compliance,
but Jimmy concluded that the remedy was worse
than the presence of the ice and managed to keep
out of reach.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Jimmy,&#8221; said Bob consolingly.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll melt pretty soon, anyhow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and it&#8217;ll be a good thing for Jimmy to
grin and bear it,&#8221; added Herb brightly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
things like that that develop one&#8217;s character.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s easy enough to be pleasant, when life
moves along like a song, but the man that&#8217;s worth
while, is the man who can smile when everything&#8217;s
going dead wrong,&#8217;&#8221; quoted Joe.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>Jimmy, not at all comforted by these noble
maxims, glared at his tormentors, and at last
Bob came to his relief, and, putting his hand inside
his collar, reached down his back and brought
up the piece of ice, now greatly reduced in size.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have it,&#8221; demanded Jimmy, as Bob was
about to throw it away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want it for?&#8221; asked Bob. &#8220;I
should think you&#8217;d seen enough of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the same principle that a man likes to look
at his aching tooth after the dentist has pulled it
out,&#8221; grinned Joe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give it to him!&#8221; exclaimed Herb, edging
away out of reach, justly fearing that he
might feel the vengeance of the outraged Jimmy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You gave it to him first, so it&#8217;s his,&#8221; decided
Bob, with the wisdom of a Solomon, as he handed
it over to the victim.
</p>
<p>Jimmy took it and started for Herb, but just
then Mr. Preston, the principal of the high school,
came along and Jimmy felt compelled to defer
his revenge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, boys?&#8221; said Mr. Preston, with
a smile. &#8220;You seem to be having a good time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy is,&#8221; returned Herb, and Jimmy covertly
shook his fist at him. &#8220;We&#8217;re making the
most of the snow and ice while it lasts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think it will last much longer,&#8221;
surmised Mr. Preston, as he walked along with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
them. &#8220;As a matter of fact, winter is &#8216;lingering
in the lap of spring&#8217; a good deal longer than usual
this year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you had a pleasant time in Washington?&#8221;
remarked Joe inquiringly, referring to
a trip from which the principal had returned only
a few days before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, indeed,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;To my mind
it&#8217;s the most interesting city in the country. I&#8217;ve
been there a number of times, and yet I always
leave there with regret. There&#8217;s the Capitol, the
noblest building on this continent and to my mind
the finest in the world. Then there&#8217;s the Congressional
Library, only second to it in beauty,
and the Washington Monument soaring into the
air to a height of five hundred and fifty-five feet,
and the superb Lincoln Memorial, and a host of
other things scarcely less wonderful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the pleasantest recollection I have of the
trip,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;was the speech I heard the
President make just before I came away. It was
simply magnificent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure was,&#8221; replied Bob enthusiastically.
&#8220;Every word of it was worth remembering. He
certainly knows how to put things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you read it in the newspaper the
next day,&#8221; said Mr. Preston, glancing at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better than that,&#8221; responded Bob, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
smile. &#8220;We all heard it over the radio while he
was making it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; replied the principal. &#8220;Then you
boys heard it even before I did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Joe, in some bewilderment.
&#8220;I understood that you were in the
crowd that listened to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I was,&#8221; Mr. Preston answered, in evident
enjoyment of their mystification. &#8220;I sat right
before him while he was speaking, not more than
a hundred feet away, saw the motion of his lips
as the words fell from them and noted the changing
expression of his features. And yet I say
again that you boys heard him before I did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite see,&#8221; said Herb, in great perplexity.
&#8220;You were only a hundred feet away and
we were hundreds of miles away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you had been thousands of miles away,
what I said would still be true,&#8221; affirmed Mr.
Preston. &#8220;No doubt there were farmers out on
the Western plains who heard him before I did.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see it&#8217;s like this,&#8221; the schoolmaster went
on to explain. &#8220;Sound travels through the air
to a distance of a little over a hundred feet in the
tenth part of a second. But in that same tenth
of a second that it took the President&#8217;s voice to
reach me in the open air radio could have carried
it eighteen thousand six hundred miles.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmy. &#8220;Eighteen thousand
six hundred miles! Not feet, fellows, but
miles!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Bob thoughtfully.
&#8220;Though I never thought of it in just that way
before. But it&#8217;s a fact that radio travels at the
rate of one hundred and eighty-six thousand
miles a second.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Equal to about seven and a half times around
the earth,&#8221; observed the principal, smiling. &#8220;In
other words, the people who were actually sitting
in the presence of the President were the very
last to hear what he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it in still another way. Suppose the President
were speaking through a megaphone in addition
to the radio and by the use of the megaphone
the voice was carried to people in the audience
a third of a mile away. By the time those
persons heard it, the man in the moon could have
heard it too&mdash;that is,&#8221; he added, with a laugh,
&#8220;supposing there really were a man in the moon
and that he had a radio receiving set.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It surely sounds like fairyland,&#8221; murmured
Joe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Radio is the fairyland of science,&#8221; replied Mr.
Preston, with enthusiasm, &#8220;in the sense that it is
full of wonder and romance. But there the similarity
ceases. Fairyland is a creation of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
fancy or the imagination. Radio is based upon
the solid rock of scientific truth. Its principles
are as certain as those of mathematics. Its problems
can be demonstrated as exactly as that two
and two make four. But it&#8217;s full of what seem
to be miracles until they are shown to be facts.
And there&#8217;s scarcely a day that passes without a
new one of these &#8216;miracles&#8217; coming to light.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had reached his corner by this time, and
with a pleasant wave of his hand he left them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure is a thirty-third degree radio fan,&#8221;
mused Joe, as they watched his retreating figure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as most all bright men are becoming,&#8221;
declared Bob. &#8220;The time is coming when a man
who doesn&#8217;t know about radio or isn&#8217;t interested
in it will be looked on as a man without intelligence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmy suddenly.
&#8220;What&#8217;s become of my piece of ice?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He opened his hand, which was red and wet
and dripping.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one on you, Jimmy, old boy,&#8221; chuckled
Joe. &#8220;It melted away while you were listening
to the prof.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an ill wind that blows nobody good,&#8221; said
Herb complacently. &#8220;Jimmy meant to put that
down my back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there are plenty of other pieces,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
Jimmy, as he picked one up and started for Herb.
</p>
<p>Herb started to run, but slipped and fell on the
icy sidewalk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what the Good Book says,&#8221; chaffed
Joe. &#8220;The wicked stand on slippery places.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I see they do,&#8221; replied Herb, as quick
as a flash, looking up at him. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The laugh was on Joe, and Herb felt so good
over the retort that he did not mind the fall,
though it had jarred him considerably. He
scrambled to his feet and brushed off his clothes,
while Jimmy, feeling that his comrade had been
punished enough, magnanimously threw away the
piece of ice that was to have been the instrument
of his vengeance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason why I wanted you fellows to be
sure to be on hand to-night,&#8221; resumed Bob, as
they walked along, &#8220;was that I saw in the program
of the Newark station in the newspaper this
morning that Larry Bartlett was down for an
entirely new stunt. You know what a hit he
made with his imitations of birds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure did,&#8221; agreed Joe. &#8220;To my mind he
had it all over the birds themselves. I never got
tired listening to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly was a dabster at it,&#8221; chimed in
Jimmy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now he&#8217;s going in to imitate animals,&#8221; explained
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
Bob. &#8220;I understand that he&#8217;s been haunting
the Zoo for weeks in every minute of his
spare time studying the bears and lions and tigers
and elephants and snakes, and getting their roars
and growls and trumpeting and hisses down to
a fine point. I bet he&#8217;ll be a riot when he gives
them to us over the radio.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure will,&#8221; assented Herb. &#8220;He&#8217;s got the
natural gift in the first place, and then he practices
and practices until he&#8217;s got everything down to
perfection.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a natural entertainer,&#8221; affirmed Bob.
&#8220;I tell you, fellows, we never did a better day&#8217;s
work than when we got Larry that job at the
sending station. Not only was it a good thing
for Larry himself when he was down and out,
but think of the pleasure he&#8217;s been able to give
to hundreds of thousands of people. I&#8217;ll bet
there&#8217;s no feature on the program that is waited
for more eagerly than his.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time the boys had reached the business
portion of the town and the short spring day
was drawing to a close. Already lights were
beginning to twinkle in the stores that lined both
sides of the street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting near supper time,&#8221; remarked Bob.
&#8220;Guess we&#8217;d better be getting along home. Don&#8217;t
forget to come&mdash;Gee whiz!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>The ejaculation was wrung from him by a
snowball that hit him squarely in the breast, staggering
him for a moment.
</p>
<p>Bang! and another snowball found a target
in Joe. It struck his shoulder and spattered all
over his face and neck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That felt as though it came from a gun!&#8221; he
exclaimed. &#8220;It&#8217;s the hardest slam I ever got.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who did it?&#8221; demanded Bob, peering about
him in the gathering darkness.
</p>
<p>Halfway up the block they saw a group of dark
figures darting into an alleyway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Buck Looker and his crowd!&#8221; cried
Jimmy. &#8220;I saw them when they ran under that
arc light.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like that crowd to take us unawares,&#8221;
said Bob. &#8220;But if they&#8217;re looking for a tussle
we can accommodate them. Get busy, fellows,
and let them have something in return for these
two sockdolagers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They hastily gathered up several snowballs
apiece, which were easily made because the snow
was soft and packed readily, and ran toward the
alleyway just in time to see Buck and his crowd
emerging from their hiding place.
</p>
<p>There was a spirited battle for a few minutes,
each side making and receiving some smashing
hits. Buck&#8217;s gang had the advantage in that
they had a large number of missiles already prepared,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
and even in the excitement of the fight the
radio boys noticed how unusually hard they were.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Must have been soaking them in water until
they froze,&#8221; grunted Jimmy, as one of them
caught him close to the neck and made him
wince.
</p>
<p>As soon as their extra ammunition was exhausted
and the contending forces in this respect
were placed more on a footing of equality, Buck
and his cronies began to give ground before the
better aim and greater determination of Bob and
his comrades.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it to them, fellows!&#8221; shouted Bob, as
the retreat of their opponents was rapidly becoming
a rout.
</p>
<p>At the moment he called out, the progress of
the fight had brought the radio boys directly in
front of the windows of one of the largest drygoods
stores in the town.
</p>
<p>In the light that came from the windows Bob
saw a snowball coming directly for his head. He
dodged, and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>Crash! There was the sound of splintering
glass, and the snowy missile whizzed through the
plate glass window!
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>IN A DILEMMA</h3>
</div>

<p>There was a moment of stupor and paralysis
as the meaning of the crash dawned upon the
radio boys.
</p>
<p>Buck and his crowd had vanished and were
footing it up the fast-darkening street at the top
of their speed.
</p>
<p>The first impulse of the radio boys was to follow
their example. They knew that none of them
was responsible for the disaster, and they were
of no mind to be sacrificed on behalf of the gang
that had attacked them. And they knew that
in affairs of that kind the ones on the ground
were apt to suffer the more severely.
</p>
<p>They actually started to run away, but had
got only a few feet from the scene of the smash
when Bob, who had been thinking quickly, called
a halt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;None of this stuff for us, fellows,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to face the music. I&#8217;m not
going to have a hunted feeling, even if we succeeded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
in getting away. We know we didn&#8217;t do
it and we&#8217;ll tell the plain truth. If that doesn&#8217;t
serve, why so much the worse for us. But at
any rate we won&#8217;t be despising ourselves as
cowards.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As usual, his comrades accorded him the leadership
and fell in with his plan, although it was
not without many misgivings that they awaited
the coming of the angry proprietor of the place,
who had already started in pursuit of them, accompanied
by many others who had been attracted
by the crash and whose numbers were
being rapidly augmented.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are the fellows that smashed my window!&#8221;
cried Mr. Larsen, the proprietor of the
drygoods store, rushing up to them and shaking
his fist in their faces. &#8220;Where are the police?&#8221;
he shouted, looking around him. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have them
arrested for malicious damage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And while he faced them, gesticulating wildly,
his face purple with anger and excitement, it may
be well for the benefit of those who have not
read the preceding volumes of this series to tell
briefly who the radio boys are and what had been
their adventures before the time this story opens.
</p>
<p>The acknowledged leader of the boys was Bob
Layton, son of a prosperous chemist of Clintonia,
in which town Bob had been born and brought
up. Mr. Layton was a respected citizen of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
town and foremost in its civic activities. Clintonia
was a thriving little city of about ten thousand
population, situated on the Shagary River,
about seventy-five miles from the city of New
York.
</p>
<p>Bob at the beginning of this story was about
sixteen years old, tall and stalwart and a clean-cut
specimen of upstanding American youth. He
was of rather dark complexion and had a pair
of eyes that looked straight at one. Those eyes
were usually merry, but could flash with indignation
when circumstances required it. He was
never on the lookout for trouble, but was always
ready to meet it half way, and his courageous
character together with his vigorous physique had
made him prominent in the sports of the boys
of his own age. He was a crack baseball player
and one of the chief factors of the high school
football eleven. No one in Clintonia was held in
better liking.
</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s special chum was Joe Atwood, son of
the leading physician of the town. Joe was fair
in complexion and sturdy in makeup. He and
Bob had been for many years almost inseparable
companions, Bob usually acting as captain in anything
in which they might be engaged, while Joe
served as first mate. The latter had a hot temper,
and his impulsiveness sometimes got him into
trouble and would have involved him in scrapes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
oftener if it had not been for the cooler head and
steadying influence of Bob.
</p>
<p>Two other friends of the boys who were almost
always in their company were Herb Fennington,
whose father kept a large general store
in the town, and Jimmy Plummer, son of a respected
carpenter and contractor. Herb was of
a rather indolent disposition, but was jolly and
good-natured and always full of jokes, some of
them good, others poor, which he frequently
sought to spring on his companions.
</p>
<p>Jimmy was a trifle younger than his mates,
fat and round and excessively fond of the good
things of life. His liking for that special dainty
had gained him the nickname of &#8220;Doughnuts,&#8221;
and few of such nicknames were ever more fittingly
bestowed.
</p>
<p>Apart from the liking that drew them together,
the boys had another link in their common interest
in radio. From the time that this wonderful
new science had begun to spread over the country
with such amazing rapidity, they had been among
the most ardent &#8220;fans.&#8221; Everything that they
could read or learn on the subject was devoured
with avidity, and they were almost constantly at
the home of one or the other, listening in on their
radio sets and, lately, sending messages, in the
latter of which they had now attained an unusual
degree of proficiency.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>In decided contrast to Bob and his friends was
another group of Clintonia youth, between whom
and the radio boys there was a pronounced antipathy.
The leader of this group was Buck Looker,
a big overgrown, hulking boy, dull in his studies
and a bully in character. His two special cronies
were Carl Lutz, a boy of about his own age, and
Terry Mooney, both of them noted for their
mean and sneaking dispositions. Buck lorded it
over them, and as his father was one of the richest
men in the town they cringed before him and
were always ready to back him up in any piece
of meanness and mischief.
</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of Bob and his friends for
radio was fostered by the help and advice of the
Reverend Doctor Dale, the clergyman in charge
of the Old First Church of Clintonia, who, in
addition to being an eloquent preacher, was keenly
interested in all latter-day developments of science,
especially radio. Whenever the boys got
into trouble with their sets they knew that all
they had to do was to go to the genial doctor
and be helped out of their perplexities.
</p>
<p>An incident that gave a great impetus to their
interest in the subject was the offering of prizes
by Mr. Ferberton, the member of Congress for
their district, for the best radio sets turned out by
the boys of his congressional district by their
own endeavors. Bob, Joe, and Jimmy entered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
into this competition with great zest. Herb with
his habitual indolence kept out of it.
</p>
<p>While the boys were engrossed with their radio
experiments an incident happened in town that
led them into many unexpected adventures. An
automobile run by a visitor in town, a Miss Nellie
Berwick, got out of her control and dashed
through the window of a store. Bob and Joe,
who happened to be at hand, rescued the girl from
imminent peril, while Herb and Jimmy did good
work in curbing the fire that followed the accident.
</p>
<p>How the boys learned of the orphan girl&#8217;s
story, got on the track of the rascal who had tried
to swindle her and forced him to make restitution;
what part the radio played in bringing the
fellow to terms; how they detected and thwarted
the plans of Buck Looker and his cronies to
wreck their sets; are told in the first volume of
this series entitled: &#8220;The Radio Boys&#8217; First
Wireless; Or, Winning the Ferberton Prize.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That summer the chums went to Ocean Point
on the seashore, where many of the Clintonia
folks had established a little bungalow colony of
their own. What adventures they met with
there; what strides they made in the practical
work of radio; how they were enabled by their
knowledge and quick application of it to save
a storm-tossed ship on which members of their
own families were voyaging; how they ran down
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
and captured the scoundrel Cassey who had
knocked out with a blackjack the operator at the
sending station and looted his safe&mdash;these and
many more incidents are narrated in the second
volume of this series entitled: &#8220;The Radio Boys
at Ocean Point; Or, The Message That Saved
the Ship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While the summer season was yet at its height,
the boys had occasion to rescue the occupants of
a rowboat that had been run down by men in a
stolen motor boat. The two rescued youths
proved to be vaudeville actors, and the boys grew
very friendly with them. The injury that crippled
one of them, Larry Bartlett; the false accusation
brought against him by Buck Looker; the
way in which the boys succeeded in getting work
for Larry at the sending station, where his remarkable
gift of mimicry received recognition;
how they themselves were placed on the broadcasting
program, and the clever way in which
they trapped the motor-boat thieves; are told in
the third volume of the series, entitled: &#8220;The
Radio Boys at the Sending Station; Or, Making
Good in the Wireless Room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The coming of fall brought the boys back to
Clintonia, where, however, the usual course of
their studies was interrupted by an epidemic that
made necessary for a time the closing of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
schools. This gave the radio boys an opportunity
to make a trip to Mountain Pass, a popular
resort in the hills. Here they came in contact
with a group of plotters who were trying to put
through a nefarious deal and were able to thwart
the rascals through the use of radio. By that
same beneficent science too they were able to save
a life when other means of communication were
blocked. And not the least satisfactory feature
was the utter discomfiture they were able to visit
upon Buck Looker and his gang. These and
many other adventures are told in the fourth
volume of the series, entitled: &#8220;The Radio Boys
at Mountain Pass; Or, The Midnight Call for
Assistance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And now to return to the radio boys as they
stood facing the angry storekeeper amid a constantly
growing throng of curious onlookers.
They had been in many tighter fixes in their
life but none that was more embarrassing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have them arrested!&#8221; the storekeeper repeated,
his voice rising to a shrill treble.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here,&#8221; replied Bob. &#8220;Suppose you
cut out this talk of having us arrested. In the
first place, we didn&#8217;t break your window. In the
second place, if we had it wouldn&#8217;t be a matter
of arrest but of making good the damage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right then,&#8221; said Mr. Larsen eagerly,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
catching at the last word. &#8220;Make good the damage.
It will cost at least two hundred dollars to
replace that window.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re a little high,&#8221; returned Bob.
&#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t matter. I didn&#8217;t say that we&#8217;d
make the damage good. I said that if we&#8217;d
broken it, it would be a matter of making good.
But we didn&#8217;t break it, and that lets us out I&#8217;ll
say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to say that,&#8221; sneered the merchant.
&#8220;How do I know that you didn&#8217;t break it? It
would of course be natural for you to try to lie
out of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be natural for us to lie out of
it,&#8221; replied Bob, controlling his temper with difficulty.
&#8220;That isn&#8217;t our way of doing things.
Why do you suppose we stayed here when it
would have been perfectly easy for us to get
away? It wasn&#8217;t a snowball we threw that broke
your window. It was one thrown by the fellows
we were fighting with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Always the other fellow that does it!&#8221; replied
the storekeeper angrily. &#8220;Who was that other
fellow or fellows then? Tell me that. Come on
now, tell me that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bob kept silent. He had no love for Buck
Looker and his gang, who had always tried to injure
him, but he was not going to inform.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; said Mr. Larsen, misunderstanding his
silence. &#8220;When I ask you, you can&#8217;t tell me.
You&#8217;re the fellows that did it, all right, and you&#8217;ll
pay me for it or I&#8217;ll have you put in jail, that&#8217;s
what I&#8217;ll do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw the fellows who were firing snowballs
in this direction,&#8221; spoke up Mr. Talley, a caterer,
pushing his way through the throng. &#8220;I nearly
bumped into them as they were running away.
Buck Looker was one of them. I saw his face
plainly and can&#8217;t be mistaken. The others I&#8217;m
not so sure of, but I think they were Carl Lutz
and Terry Mooney.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For my part, Mr. Larsen,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see how a snowball could break that heavy
plate-glass window, anyway. My windows are
no heavier, and they&#8217;ve often had snowballs come
against them without doing any harm. Are you
sure it wasn&#8217;t something else that smashed the
glass?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead sure,&#8221; replied Larsen. &#8220;Come inside
and see for yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He led the way into his store, and Mr. Talley,
the boys, and a number of others crowded in
after him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said Larsen, pointing to a piece of
dress goods that had been hanging in the window.
&#8220;See where the snow has splashed against it?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
There&#8217;s no question that a snowball did it. You
can see the bits of snow around here yet if you&#8217;ll
only look.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was true and the evidence seemed conclusive.
But just then Bob&#8217;s keen eyes detected
something else. He stooped down and brought
up quite a large sharp-edged stone which still had
some fragments of snow adhering to it and held
it up for all to see.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the answer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This stone
was packed in the snowball, and that is why it
smashed the window!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE STUTTERING VOICE</h3>
</div>

<p>There was a stir of interest and exclamations
of surprise as those in the store crowded closer
to get a better view.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That explains it,&#8221; said Mr. Talley, as he examined
the missile. &#8220;I was sure that no mere
ball of snow could break that heavy window.
To put such a stone in a snowball was little less
than criminal,&#8221; he went on gravely. &#8220;If that had
hit any one on the temple it would almost certainly
have killed him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was coming straight for my head when I
dodged,&#8221; said Bob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s another proof that it wasn&#8217;t any ball
we threw that broke the window,&#8221; put in Joe.
&#8220;Each one of us is willing to swear that there
was no stone in any ball that we threw.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only then but at any time,&#8221; put in Herb.
&#8220;Only a mean coward would do a thing like that.
None of us has done it any time in his life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that,&#8221; replied Mr. Talley. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
known all you boys ever since you were little kids
and I know you wouldn&#8217;t be capable of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well,&#8221; said Mr. Larsen. &#8220;But
that doesn&#8217;t pay for my window. Whether any
of you boys threw the ball or not you can&#8217;t deny
that you were engaged in a snowball fight right
in front of my windows. If the fight hadn&#8217;t been
going on the window wouldn&#8217;t have been
smashed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a certain amount of justice in this,
and the boys were fair enough to acknowledge it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you are right there, Mr. Larsen,&#8221;
said Bob regretfully. &#8220;We ought to have kept
out of range of the windows, but in the excitement
we forgot all about that. Then, too, we
never would have supposed that any ordinary
snowball would have broken the window. Perhaps
that was in the back of our minds, if we
thought of it at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the window insured?&#8221; queried Mr. Talley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; answered the storekeeper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, that lets you out,&#8221; remarked Mr.
Talley, with a note of relief in his voice. &#8220;That
puts the matter up to the insurance company. If
they want to take any legal steps they can; and
of course they ought to be compensated by the
parents of the boy who may be found guilty of
having thrown the ball with a stone in it. For
my part, I doubt very much that it can ever be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
proved, unless the boy himself owns up to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of Buck Looker ever owning up to
anything!&#8221; muttered Jimmy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As for these boys,&#8221; continued Mr. Talley,
&#8220;I am perfectly sure in my own mind that they are
telling the truth. You&#8217;ll have to look for the
culprit in the other crowd, and I&#8217;ve already told
you who they are, or who one of them is, at
least.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the storekeeper, who by this time
had cooled down considerably, &#8220;that, I suppose,
will be something for the insurance company to
settle. But by the terms of my contract with
them I&#8217;ll have to help them all I can to find out
the responsible party, and I&#8217;ll have to give them
the names of all the boys concerned in the fight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; responded Bob. &#8220;You
know our folks and you know that they&#8217;re good
for any judgment that may be found against
them. But I&#8217;m sure it will be somebody else that
will have to pay the bill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was nothing more to be done for the
present, and the boys filed out of the store, after
having expressed their thanks to Mr. Talley for
the way he had championed their cause.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; murmured Joe, as they went up the
street toward their homes, &#8220;I know how a fellow
feels now after he&#8217;s been put through the third
degree.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It was rather a hot session,&#8221; agreed Bob.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m glad we had it out with him instead of
running away. It&#8217;s always best to take the bull
by the horns. And you can&#8217;t blame Mr. Larsen
for feeling sore about it. Any one of us would
probably have felt the same way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; admitted Herb. &#8220;But think of
that dirty trick of Buck Looker in putting stones
in snowballs! It wasn&#8217;t only that one that went
through the window. Every time I got hit it
made me jump.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;I was thinking
all the time that they were the hardest snowballs
I ever felt, but it never came into my mind that
there were stones in them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust Buck to be up to every mean trick that
any one ever thought of,&#8221; returned Bob. &#8220;He
hasn&#8217;t got over the way we showed him up at
Mountain Pass. He thought he had us dead
to rights in the matter of that burned cottage, and
it made him wild to see the way we came out on
top. He and his gang would do anything to get
even.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be interesting to see what he&#8217;ll say when
this matter of the window is put up to him and
his pals,&#8221; remarked Herb.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a doubt in the world what he&#8217;ll say,&#8221; replied
Joe. &#8220;He&#8217;ll swear till he&#8217;s blue in the face
that he never dreamed of using a stone in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
snowballs. Do you remember how he told us
that he&#8217;d lie in court to keep us from putting anything
over on him? Any one that expects to get
the truth out of Buck is barking up the wrong
tree. I guess the insurance company would better
kiss their money good-by.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so,&#8221; returned Bob. &#8220;It was dark
and there probably weren&#8217;t any witnesses who
saw them put the stones in, and it is likely that the
company will have to let the matter drop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lads had reached Bob&#8217;s gate by this time,
and they separated with a promise to come over
and listen in on the radio later on.
</p>
<p>Bob told the whole story to his parents at the
supper table that night, and his father and mother
listened with great interest and some concern.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you were mixed up in the thing at
all, Bob,&#8221; his father remarked thoughtfully.
&#8220;Being in it, however, you acted just as you
should have done. Just how far you and your
friends may be held responsible, in case they can&#8217;t
find the one who actually threw the ball that broke
the window, I&#8217;m not lawyer enough to say. It&#8217;s
barely possible that there may be some ground
for action on the score of culpable carelessness in
taking part in a snowball fight in front of store
windows, and of course you were wrong in doing
that. But the total amount involved is not very
great after all, and it would be divided up among
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
the parents of the four of you, so there&#8217;s nothing
much to worry about. It would gall me though to
have to pay for damages that were really caused
by that cub of Looker&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Dad,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;m hoping yet
that something may develop that will put the
thing up to Buck, or whoever it was of his gang
that actually threw the ball.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope so,&#8221; returned Mr. Layton, though
without much conviction in his voice, and dismissed
the subject.
</p>
<p>A little while afterward the other three boys
came over to Bob&#8217;s house to listen in on the radio
concert. So much time, however, had been taken
up in discussing the afternoon&#8217;s adventure that
they missed Larry&#8217;s offering, which was among
the first on the program. This was a keen disappointment,
which was tempered, however, by the
probability that they could hear him some evening
later in the week.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; remarked Joe. &#8220;But it only means
that we still have a treat in store when the old
boy begins to roar and growl and hiss so as to
make us think that a whole menagerie has broken
loose and is chasing us. In the meantime we can
fix up that aerial so as to get a little better results.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny thing I noticed the other day,&#8221; remarked
Bob, as they embarked upon some experiments.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All sorts of funny things in the radio game,&#8221;
observed Joe. &#8220;Something new turns up every
day. Things in your set that you think you can&#8217;t
do without you find you can do without and get
results just about as usual.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I was going to tell you,&#8221; returned
Bob. &#8220;You must be something of a prophet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t go quite so far as to say that,&#8221;
replied Joe, with mock modesty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he the shrinking violet?&#8221; chaffed Jimmy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop your kidding, you boobs, and let a regular
fellow talk,&#8221; chided Bob. &#8220;What I was going
to say was that while I was tinkering with the
set I disconnected the ground wire. Of course
I thought that would put the receiver out of business
for the time, and I was almost knocked silly
when I found that I could hear the concert that
was going on just about as well as though the
wire had been connected. How do you account
for that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t account for it at all,&#8221; replied Herb.
&#8220;Probably just a freak, and might not happen
again in a thousand times. Likely it was one of
the unexplainable things that happen once in a
while. Maybe there was a ground connection
of some kind, if not by the wire. I wouldn&#8217;t
bank on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s queer, too, how many kinds of things can
be used as aerials,&#8221; put in Joe. &#8220;I heard the other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
day of a man in an apartment house where the
owner objected to aerials, who used the clothesline
for that purpose. The wire ran through the
rope, which covered it so that it couldn&#8217;t be seen.
It didn&#8217;t prevent its use as a clothesline either, for
he could hear perfectly when the wash was hanging
on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, almost anything will do as an aerial,&#8221;
chimed in Jimmy. &#8220;The rib of an umbrella, the
rainspout at the side of the house, the springs of a
bed give good results. And that&#8217;s one of the
mighty good things about radio. People that have
to count the pennies don&#8217;t have to buy a lot of
expensive materials. They can put a set together
with almost any old thing that happens to be
knocking around the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bob had been working steadily, and, as the
room was warm, his hands were moist with perspiration.
He had unhooked an insulated copper
wire that led to his outside aerial. His head
phones were on, as he had been listening to the
radio concert while he worked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to miss the rest of that selection, I
guess,&#8221; he remarked regretfully, as he unhooked
the wire. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pity, too, for that&#8217;s one of the
finest violin solos I ever heard. Great Scott!
What does that mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The ejaculation was wrenched from him by
the fact that although he had disconnected the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
wire he still heard the music&mdash;a little fainter than
before but still with every note distinct.
</p>
<p>He could scarcely believe his ears and looked
at his friends in great bewilderment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Joe, jumping to
his feet. &#8220;Get a shock?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the sense you mean, but in another
way, yes,&#8221; replied Bob, still holding the exposed
end of the copper wire in his fingers. &#8220;What do
you think of that, fellows? I&#8217;m an aerial!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out of your trance,&#8221; adjured Herb
unbelievingly. &#8220;They talk that way in the insane
asylums.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clap on your headphones,&#8221; cried Bob, too intent
on his discovery to pay any attention to the
gibe.
</p>
<p>They did so, and were amazed at hearing the
selection as plainly as did Bob himself.
</p>
<p>The latter had been holding the disconnected
wire so that his fingers just touched the uncovered
copper portion at the end. Now he hastily scraped
off several inches of the insulation and grasped
the copper wire with his hand. Instantly the
volume of sound grew perceptibly greater.
</p>
<p>Hardly knowing what to make of it, he scraped
off still more of the insulation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, you fellows,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Each of
you take hold of this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joe was the first to respond, and the sound became
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
louder. Then Herb and Jimmy followed
suit, and it was evident that they served as amplifiers,
for with each additional hand the music
swelled to greater volume.
</p>
<p>The boys looked at each other as if asking
whether this was all real or if they had suddenly
been transferred to some realm of fancy. They
would not have been greatly surprised to wake
up suddenly and find that they had been dreaming.
</p>
<p>But there was no delusion about it and they listened
without saying another word until, in a
glorious strain of melody, the selection came to
an end. Nor did they break the silence until a
band orchestra was announced and crashed into a
brilliant overture.
</p>
<p>While it was still in full swing, Bob had an inspiration.
He took off his headphones and
clamped them on to the phonograph that stood
on a table near by. Instantly the music became
intensified and filled the room. When all their
hands were on the wire, it became so loud that
they had to close the doors of the phonograph.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; gasped Bob, when the last strain had
died away and the demonstration was complete,
&#8220;that&#8217;s something new on me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never dreamed of anything like it,&#8221; said Joe,
sinking back in his chair. &#8220;Of course we know
that the human body has electrical capacity and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
that operators sometimes have to use metal shields
to protect the tube from the influence of the
hand. And in our loop aerial at Ocean Point you
noticed that the receptivity of the tube was modified
when we touched it with our fingers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, in theory,&#8221; observed Bob thoughtfully,
&#8220;the human body possesses inductance as
well as capacity, and so might serve as an antenna.
But I never thought of demonstrating it in practice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So Bob is an aerial,&#8221; grinned Herb. &#8220;I always
knew he was a &#8216;live wire,&#8217; but I never figured
him out as an antenna.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t forget that if Bob is an aerial we&#8217;re
amplifiers,&#8221; put in Jimmy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s glory enough for all,&#8221; laughed Joe.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to tell Doctor Dale and Frank Brandon
about this. We&#8217;ve got so many tips from
them that it&#8217;s about time we made it the other
way around.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were so excited about this new development
which they had stumbled upon purely
through accident that they sat talking about it for
a long time until Bob chanced to look at his watch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just have time for the last selection,&#8221; he remarked,
as he reconnected the aerial. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
wind up in the regular way this time. It&#8217;s an aria
from Lucia and I don&#8217;t want to miss it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>He had some difficulty in making his adjustment,
as there was a lot of interference at the
moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Raft of amateurs horning in,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;All of them seem to have chosen just this time
to do it. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped as though he had been shot, and
listened intently. Then he beckoned to the others
to adjust their headphones.
</p>
<p>Into the receiver was coming a succession of
stuttering sounds that eventually succeeded in
framing intelligible words. Ordinarily this might
have provoked laughter, but not now. They had
heard that voice before.
</p>
<p>It was the voice of Dan Cassey!
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A PUZZLING MYSTERY</h3>
</div>

<p>For the second time that evening the radio boys
thought they must be dreaming.
</p>
<p>Cassey! Cassey the swindler, whom they had
compelled to make restitution to the victim he
had wronged. Cassey the thug, whom they had
captured in that wild chase after he had looted the
safe and nearly killed the operator in the sending
station. Cassey the convict, who, to their certain
knowledge, had been sentenced to a long term in
prison.
</p>
<p>What was Cassey doing over the radio? That
it was that scoundrel they had no doubt. The
stuttering, the tones of the voice, the occasional
whistle which he indulged in in order to go on&mdash;all
these things they recognized perfectly. It was
the wildest kind of improbability that he had a
double anywhere who could reproduce him so
perfectly.
</p>
<p>Gone now was any thought of the aria from
Lucia. Bob motioned frantically to Jimmy to
hand him a pencil and a sheet of paper. Then he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
jotted down the words, as after great efforts they
fell one by one from the stutterer&#8217;s lips. As
Bob did this he bent over the paper in frowning
perplexity. The words themselves were intelligible,
but they did not seem to make sense, nor
was there anywhere a connected sentence.
</p>
<p>Finally the stammering voice ceased, and after
they had waited several minutes longer to make
sure that it would not resume, the boys took off
their headphones and gazed at each other in utter
bewilderment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be blessed!&#8221; exclaimed Joe. &#8220;That
villain Cassey, of all men on the face of the earth!
What do you make of it, Bob?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to make of it,&#8221; confessed
Bob. &#8220;It has simply knocked me endways. I
never thought to hear of that rascal again for the
rest of my life. Yet here he is, less than a year
after he&#8217;s been sentenced, talking over the radio.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he&#8217;s received a pardon,&#8221; hazarded
Jimmy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all likely,&#8221; answered Bob. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t as
though he were a first offender. He&#8217;s old in
crime. You remember the raking over the judge
gave him when he sentenced him. Told him if
he had it in his power he&#8217;d give him more than
he actually did. No, I think we can dismiss that
idea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it possible,&#8221; suggested Herb, &#8220;that he&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
employed as radio operator in the prison? He
understands sending and receiving all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t strike me hard either,&#8221; Bob objected.
&#8220;Likely enough the prison is equipped
with a wireless set, but it isn&#8217;t probable that they&#8217;d
let a prisoner operate it. It would give him too
good a chance to get in touch with confederates
outside the jail. Then, too, his stuttering would
make him a laughing stock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only explanation that I can see,&#8221; he went
on, &#8220;is that he&#8217;s escaped, and he&#8217;s sending this
message on his own hook. Though what the message
is about is beyond me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what did you get down?&#8221; asked Jimmy
curiously. &#8220;I caught a few words, but I don&#8217;t remember
them all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a regular hodgepodge,&#8221; replied Bob,
spreading out the sheet of paper, while they all
crowded around to read.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Corn&mdash;hay&mdash;six&mdash;paint&mdash;water&mdash;slow&mdash;sick&mdash;jelly,&#8221;
read Joe aloud. &#8220;Sounds to me like the
ravings of a delirium patient.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet I&#8217;m sure that I got all the words
down right,&#8221; said Bob perplexedly. &#8220;It must be
a code of some kind. We can&#8217;t understand it, and
Cassey didn&#8217;t mean that any one should except
some one person whose ear was glued to a radiophone.
But you can bet that that person understood
it all right.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if we couldn&#8217;t make it out,&#8221; suggested
Herb.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No harm in trying,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;though compared
to this a Chinese puzzle is as simple as
A B C. Let&#8217;s take a hack at it, anyhow. We&#8217;ll
each take a separate sheet of paper and try to get
something out of it that makes sense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For nearly an hour the boys did their best.
They put the words in different orders, read them
forward and backward. But the ideas conveyed
by the separate words were so utterly dissimilar
that they could frame nothing that had the
slightest glimmering of sense and they were finally
compelled to give it up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If time were money, we&#8217;d spend enough on
this stuff to make us bankrupt,&#8221; Joe remarked, in
vast disgust, as he rose to get his cap. &#8220;Dan
Cassey was foxy when he made this up. We&#8217;ll
have to give the rascal credit for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted Herb, &#8220;it&#8217;s the best kind of a
code. Any one of those words might mean any
one of a hundred thousand things. A man might
spend a lifetime on it and be no nearer success at
the end than he was when he started. The only
way it can be unraveled is by finding the key that
tells what the words stand for. And even that
may not exist in written form. The fellows may
simply have committed them to memory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do!&#8221; Bob exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll get the prison to-morrow on the long distance
&#8217;phone and ask them about Cassey. I&#8217;ll tell them
all about this radio message, and it may be a valuable
tip to them. They may be able to locate the
station from which the messages come, if there
are any more of them. You remember how Mr.
Brandon located Cassey&#8217;s sending station the first
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bob was as good as his word, and got in communication
with the prison just before school
time. The warden was gruff and inclined to be
uncommunicative at first, but his manner changed
remarkably after he heard of the radio message
and he inquired eagerly for the slightest details.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Cassey has escaped,&#8221; he told Bob. &#8220;He
got away about two months ago. He had behaved
himself well for the first six months of his imprisonment,
and we made him a trusty. In that
capacity he had access to various parts of the
prison and occasionally to my own quarters,
which are in a wing connected with the prison.
In some way that hasn&#8217;t yet been discovered he
got possession of clothes to cover his prison uniform
and got away one day from the yard in
which he was working. Probably with his help,
two others got away at the same time. Their
names are Jake Raff and Toppy Gillen, both of
them desperate criminals and in for long terms.
Likely enough the three of them are operating together
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
somewhere. We made a careful search for
them and have sent out descriptions of them to the
police of all the important cities in the United
States. But this clue of yours is the only one we
have, and it may prove a most important one.
I&#8217;ll see that the Federal radio authorities are notified
at once. Keep in touch with me and let me
know if you come across anything else that seems
to point to Cassey. His escape is a sore point
with me, and I&#8217;d be glad to have him once more
behind the bars. You can be sure he&#8217;ll never get
away again until he&#8217;s served out the last day of
his sentence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a warm expression of thanks the warden
hung up his telephone receiver, and Bob hurried
off to school to tell his comrades of what he had
learned.
</p>
<p>There was no chance for this, however, before
recess, as he had been kept so long at the telephone
that he was barely able to reach the school before
the bell rang.
</p>
<p>When at last he told them of his talk with the
warden, they listened with spellbound interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So the villain managed to escape, did he?&#8221;
ruminated Joe. &#8220;That&#8217;s a black mark against the
warden, and it&#8217;s no wonder he&#8217;s anxious to get
him back. I&#8217;d hate to be in Cassey&#8217;s shoes if the
prison gates ever close on him again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think it would be a comparatively easy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
matter to capture him,&#8221; suggested Herb. &#8220;The
fact that he stutters so badly makes him a marked
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can bet that he doesn&#8217;t do any more talking
than he can help,&#8221; replied Joe. &#8220;And, for that
matter, I suppose there are a good many thousand
stutterers in the United States. Almost every
town has one or more. Of course it&#8217;s against
him, but it doesn&#8217;t by any means make it a sure
thing that he&#8217;ll be nabbed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Buck Looker and his cronies happened to pass
them in the yard just at that moment and caught
the last word. Buck whispered something to Carl
Lutz, and the latter broke out into uproarious
laughter.
</p>
<p>It was so obviously directed against Joe that his
impulsive temper took fire at once. He stepped
up to the trio, despite Bob&#8217;s outstretched hand
that tried to restrain him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you fellows laughing at me?&#8221; he asked
of the three, though his eyes were fastened directly
on Buck&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not especially at you,&#8221; returned Buck insolently.
&#8220;But at something you said.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what was that?&#8221; asked Joe, coming a
step nearer, at which Buck stepped back a trifle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About getting nabbed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It made
me think of some fellows I know that were
nabbed last night for breaking windows.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that was it!&#8221; remarked Joe, with dangerous
calmness while his fist clenched. &#8220;Now let
me tell you what it reminds me of. It makes me
think of three cowards who smashed a window
last night with a stone packed in a snowball and
then ran away as fast as their legs could carry
them. Perhaps you&#8217;d like me to tell you their
names?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about,&#8221; retorted
Buck, changing color.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you do,&#8221; replied Joe. &#8220;And while
I&#8217;m about it, I&#8217;ll add that the fellows who smashed
the window were not only cowards, but worse.
And their names are Buck Looker, Carl Lutz and
Terry Mooney.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; cried Buck, bristling up, while
an angry growl arose from his cronies.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You heard me the first time,&#8221; replied Joe;
&#8220;but to get it into your thick heads I&#8217;ll say it
again. The cowards, and worse, I referred to
are named Buck Looker, Carl Lutz and Terry
Mooney.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>MARVELS OF WIRELESS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fighting talk,&#8221; blustered Buck, as he
made a pretense of getting ready to throw off
his coat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s precisely what I want it to be,&#8221; declared
Joe, as he tore off his coat and threw it to the
ground.
</p>
<p>By this time most of the boys in the school
yard had sensed the tenseness of the situation and
had gathered around Joe and Buck, forming a
ring many lines deep.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A fight!&#8221; was the cry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go in, Joe!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Soak him, Buck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before Joe&#8217;s determined attitude and flashing
eyes, Buck wavered. He fingered his coat uncertainly
and glanced toward the school windows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one of the teachers looking out,&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;And it&#8217;s against the rules to fight on
the school grounds. If it wasn&#8217;t for that I&#8217;d
beat you up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>There was a general snicker from the boys at
Buck Looker&#8217;s sudden regard for the rules of the
school.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any other place you can think of where you&#8217;d
like to beat me up?&#8221; said Joe sarcastically. &#8220;How
about this afternoon after school down by the
river?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;&mdash;I&#8217;ve got to go out of town this afternoon,&#8221;
Buck stammered. &#8220;But don&#8217;t you worry. I&#8217;ll
give you all the fight you&#8217;re looking for the first
chance I get.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Murmurs of derision arose from the crowd,
and the flush on the bully&#8217;s sour face grew much
deeper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just a yellow dog, Buck!&#8221; exclaimed
Joe, in disgust. &#8220;Have I got to pull your nose to
make you stand up to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He advanced toward him, and Buck retreated.
What would have happened next will never be
known, for just at that moment one of the teachers
emerged from the school and came toward
the ring. Hostilities at the moment were out of
the question, and the boys began to scatter. Buck
heaved a sigh of evident relief, and now that he
felt himself safe, all his old bluster came back to
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty lucky for you that Bixby came out
just then,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I was just getting ready
to thrash you within an inch of your life.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>Joe laughed sarcastically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble with you, Buck, is that you spend
so much time getting ready that you never have
any time for real fighting,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;It
took you an awfully long time to get your coat
unbuttoned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They laugh best who laugh last,&#8221; growled
Buck. &#8220;And don&#8217;t forget that you fellows have
got to pay for that glass you broke.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got another guess coming,&#8221; replied
Joe. &#8220;You or one of your gang broke that glass
and we can prove it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t downtown that night at all,&#8221; said
Buck glibly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t add any more lies to your score,&#8221; said
Joe scornfully. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got you! You and your
gang are the only fellows in town who would put
stones in snowballs, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s all the evidence you&#8217;ve got, it
wouldn&#8217;t go far in a court of law,&#8221; sneered Buck.
&#8220;Any judge would see that you were trying to
back out of it by putting it up to somebody else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you don&#8217;t know that Mr. Talley
bumped into you while you were running away,&#8221;
remarked Joe.
</p>
<p>This shot told, for Buck had banked on the
darkness and had forgotten all about his encounter
with Mr. Talley. He had been nursing the
comfortable assurance that all he had to do was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
to deny. Now his house of cards had come tumbling
about his ears. Mr. Talley was a respected
citizen, and his word would be accepted by everybody.
</p>
<p>Joe saw the effect of his remark and smiled
drily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to revise that statement of yours that
you weren&#8217;t downtown at all last night?&#8221; he
asked, with affected politeness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&mdash;he was mistaken,&#8221; stammered Buck
weakly, as he walked away, followed by his discomfited
cronies.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that will hold him for a while,&#8221;
chuckled Jimmy, as the radio boys watched his
retreating figure.
</p>
<p>Two or three days passed without special developments.
The broken pane of glass had been
restored and the parents of the boys had been
formally notified by the insurance company that
they would be held responsible jointly for the
damages. A similar notice had been sent to the
fathers of Buck and his mates.
</p>
<p>Mr. Looker replied, denying that his son was
at all implicated in the matter and refusing to
pay. Mr. Layton admitted that his son had been
throwing snowballs in front of the store on the
night in question, but he stated that he had not
thrown the ball with a stone in it that broke the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
window. He added that any further communication
regarding the matter could be sent to his
lawyer.
</p>
<p>Of the others involved, some had taken similar
positions and others had ignored the matter altogether,
leaving it to the insurance company to
make the next move. And there for the time the
matter rested.
</p>
<p>The radio boys had missed Larry&#8217;s performance
on the night that he had opened with his new
repertoire, but they were bound not to be cheated
of the second, which took place only a few nights
later.
</p>
<p>They crowded eagerly about the radio set when
their friend&#8217;s turn was announced, and listened
with a breathless interest, that was intensified by
their warm personal regard for the performer, to
the rendition of the cries of various animals with
which Larry regaled them.
</p>
<p>The imitations were so lifelike that the boys
might well have imagined they were in a zoölogical
garden. Lions, tigers, bears, elephants, snakes,
moose, and other specimens of the animal and
the reptile tribes were imitated with a fidelity that
was amazing. In addition, the renditions were
interspersed with droll and lively comments by
Larry that added immensely to the humor of the
performance. When at last it was over, the boys
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
broke out into enthusiastic hand-clapping that
would have warmed Larry&#8217;s heart, had he been
able to hear it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The old boy is all there!&#8221; chortled Bob enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a wonder!&#8221; ejaculated Joe. &#8220;No question
there of a square peg in a round hole. He&#8217;s
found exactly the work in life he&#8217;s specially fitted
for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And think of the audience he has,&#8221; put in
Jimmy. &#8220;At this very minute there are probably
hundreds of thousands of people who have been
tickled to death at his performance. Just suppose
those people all clapped their hands at once just
as we have done and we could hear it. Why, it
would be like a young earthquake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this moment the doorbell rang, and Dr.
Dale was announced. He spent a few minutes
with Mr. and Mrs. Layton, and then came up to
have a little chat with the boys. This was one
thing he never overlooked. His interest in and
sympathy with the young were unbounded, and
accounted largely for the influence that he exerted
in the community.
</p>
<p>The radio boys greeted the minister warmly
and gladly made room for him around the table.
His coming was never felt by them to be an interruption.
They regarded him almost as one
of themselves. Apart, too, from the thorough
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
liking they had for him as a man, they were exceedingly
grateful to him for the help he had
been to them in radio matters. He was their
mentor, guide and friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew I&#8217;d find you busy with the radio,&#8221; he
said, with a genial smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t be torn away from it,&#8221; replied Bob.
&#8220;We think it&#8217;s just the greatest thing that ever
happened. Just now we&#8217;ve been listening to Larry
Bartlett give his imitations of animals. You remember
Larry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do,&#8221; replied Dr. Dale. &#8220;And I remember
how you boys helped him get his present
position. It was one of the best things you ever
did. He&#8217;s certainly a finished artist. I heard him
on his opening night, and I&#8217;ve laughed thinking of
it many times since. He&#8217;s a most amusing entertainer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the first opportunity the boys had had
to tell the doctor of the night when Bob found
that he was a human aerial, and he listened to the
many details of the experiment with absorbed
interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something new to me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
boys have reason to be gratified at having had a
novel experience. That&#8217;s the beauty of radio.
Something new is always cropping up. Many of
the other sciences have been more or less fully
explored, and while none of them will ever be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
exhausted, their limits have been to some extent
indicated. But in radio we&#8217;re standing just on the
threshold of a science whose infinite possibilities
have not even been guessed. One discovery
crowds so closely on the heels of another that we
have all we can do to keep track of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just got back from a little trip up in New
York State,&#8221; he went on, as he settled himself
more comfortably in his chair, &#8220;and I stopped off
at Schenectady to look over the big radio station
there. By great good luck, Marconi happened to
be there on the same day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marconi!&#8221; breathed Bob. &#8220;The father of
wireless!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; smiled Dr. Dale. &#8220;Or if you want to
put it in another way, the Christopher Columbus
who discovered the New World of radio. I
counted it a special privilege to get a glimpse of
him. But what attracted my special attention in
the little while I could spend there was a small
tube about eighteen inches long and two inches in
diameter which many radio experts think will
completely revolutionize long distance radio communication.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the Langmuir tube,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;I
was reading of it the other day, and it seems to
be a dandy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonderful thing,&#8221; replied the doctor.
&#8220;Likely enough it will take the place of the great
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
transatlantic plants which require so much room
and such enormous machinery. It&#8217;s practically
noiseless. Direct current is sent into the wire
through a complicated wire system and generates
a high frequency current of tremendous power.
I saw it working when it was connected with an
apparatus carrying about fifteen thousand volts
of electricity in a direct current. A small blue
flame shot through the tube with scarcely a particle
of noise. The broken impulse from the electrical
generators behind the tube was sent through
the tube to be flung off from the antenna into space
in the dots and dashes of the international code.
That little tube was not much bigger than a stick
of dynamite, but was infinitely more powerful.
I was so fascinated by it and all that it meant
that it was hard work to tear myself away from
it. It marks a great step forward in the field
of radio.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been wonderfully interesting,&#8221;
remarked Bob. &#8220;And yet I suppose that in a
year or two something new will be invented that
will put even that out of date.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s practically certain that there will be,&#8221; assented
the doctor. &#8220;The miracles of to-day become
the commonplaces of to-morrow. That
fifty-kilowatt tube that develops twelve horsepower
within its narrow walls of glass, wonderful
as it is, is bound to be superseded by something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
better, and the inventor himself would be the first
one to admit it. Some of the finest scientific
brains in the country are working on the problem,
and he would be a bold prophet and probably a
false prophet that would set any bounds to its
possibilities.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Radio is yet in its infancy,&#8221; the doctor concluded,
as he rose to go. &#8220;But one thing is certain.
In the lifetime of those who witnessed its
birth it will become a giant&mdash;but a benevolent
giant who, instead of destroying will re-create our
civilization.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE FOREST RANGER</h3>
</div>

<p>Some days later Bob and Herb and Joe were
on their way to Bob&#8217;s house to do a little experimenting
on the latter&#8217;s set, when they were
surprised at the alacrity with which Jimmy turned
a corner and came puffing up to them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, fellows!&#8221; he yelled, as he came within
earshot, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got some mighty interesting news
for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have it,&#8221; said Bob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about the snowball Buck fired through
the window,&#8221; panted Jimmy, falling into step beside
them. &#8220;I met a man who&#8217;s staying up at the
Sterling House. He says Buck&#8217;s the boy who
did it, all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How does he know?&#8221; all of the others asked
with interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Saw Buck pick up a stone and pack the snow
hard around it,&#8221; said Jimmy importantly. &#8220;He
saw it himself, so we&#8217;ve got one witness for our
side, all right.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; said Bob, adding, with a glint
in his eye: &#8220;Say, wouldn&#8217;t I like to get my
hands on Buck, just for about five minutes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you won&#8217;t have a chance,&#8221; said Jimmy,
enjoying being the bearer of so much news.
&#8220;Buck&#8217;s gone with his father to a lumber camp
up in Braxton woods.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know all this?&#8221; inquired Herb
curiously. &#8220;You seem to be chock full of information
to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a little bird told me,&#8221; said Jimmy, looking
mysterious. However, as Herb made a threatening
motion toward him, he hurried to explain. &#8220;I
met Terry Mooney,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I told him I knew
all about who put the stone in the snowball and I
told him that our crowd was going to make his
look like two cents. He laughed and said swell
chance we&#8217;d have. Said Buck had gone to the
lumber camp with his father and that he and
Carl Lutz were going to join him in a day or two.
Just like Buck to run away when he knows there&#8217;s
a good licking coming to him!&#8221; added Jimmy,
with a sneer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, what do we care?&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;At
least we sha&#8216;n&#8217;t have those fellows around spoiling
all the fun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you found out about the snowball
just the same,&#8221; said Bob thoughtfully. &#8220;Every
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
little bit helps when we have to fight against that
crooked gang of Buck&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s hoping,&#8221; said Herb fervently, &#8220;that
they stay away all the rest of the spring.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time the lads had reached Bob&#8217;s house.
It was Saturday afternoon, and as the boys
crowded noisily into the hall Bob noticed that his
father was in the library and that he seemed to
have company.
</p>
<p>He was starting upstairs with the other lads
when his father came out of the library and called
to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on in for a few minutes, boys,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I have a friend here who is a man after your own
hearts,&#8221; and his eyes twinkled. &#8220;He&#8217;s interested
in radio.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys needed no second invitation, for they
never missed an opportunity of meeting any one
who could tell them something about the wonders
of radio.
</p>
<p>Mr. Layton&#8217;s guest was lounging in one of the
great chairs in the library, and from the moment
the boys laid eyes on him they knew they were
going to hear something of more than usual interest.
</p>
<p>The stranger was big, over six feet, and his
face and hands were like a Cuban&#8217;s, they were so
dark. Even his fair hair seemed to have been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
burnt a darker hue by the sun. There was a tang
of the great out-of-doors about him, a hint of open
spaces and adventure that fascinated the radio
boys.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my son, Mr. Bentley,&#8221; said Mr. Layton
to the lounging stranger, still with a twinkle
in his eye. &#8220;And the other boys are his inseparable
companions. Also I think they are almost
as crazy about radio as you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The stranger laughed and turned to Bob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been upstairs to see your set,&#8221; he said,
adding heartily: &#8220;It&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ve seldom seen
better amateur equipment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>If Bob had liked this stranger before, it was
nothing to what he felt for him now. To the
radio boys, if any one praised their radio sets, this
person, no matter who it was, promptly became
their friend for life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you think it&#8217;s pretty good,&#8221; Bob
said modestly. &#8220;We fellows have surely worked
hard enough over it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This gentleman here,&#8221; said Mr. Layton to the
boys, &#8220;ought to know quite a bit about radio. He
operates an airplane in the service of our Government
Forestry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the United States Forest Service?&#8221; cried
Bob, breathlessly, eyeing the stranger with increasing
interest. &#8220;And is your airplane equipped
with radio?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very much so,&#8221; replied Mr. Bentley. &#8220;It
seems almost a fairy tale&mdash;what radio has done
for the Forest Service.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve read a lot about the fighting of forest
fires,&#8221; broke in Joe eagerly. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t know
radio had anything to do with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It hadn&#8217;t until the last few years,&#8221; the visitor
answered, adding, with a laugh: &#8220;But now it&#8217;s
pretty near the whole service!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell us something about what you
do?&#8221; asked Bob.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bentley waved a deprecating hand while
Mr. Layton leaned back in his chair with the
air of one who is enjoying himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so much what I do,&#8221; protested this interesting
newcomer, while the boys hung upon his
every word. &#8220;It is what radio has done in the
fighting of forest fires that is the marvelous, the
almost unbelievable, thing. The man who first
conceived the idea of bringing radio into the
wilderness had to meet and overcome the same
discouragements that fall to the lot of every
pioneer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The government declared that the cost of
carrying and setting up the radio apparatus would
be greater than the loss occasioned every season
by the terribly destructive forest fires. But there
was a fellow named Adams who thought he knew
better.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Adams!&#8221; repeated Bob breathlessly. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t
he the fellow who had charge of the Mud Creek
ranger station at Montana?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The visitor nodded and gazed at Bob with interest.
&#8220;How did you know?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I read something about him a while ago,&#8221;
answered Bob vaguely. He was chiefly interested
in having Mr. Bentley go on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think,&#8221; said Herb, &#8220;that it would
be pretty hard work carrying delicate radio apparatus
into the lumber country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet your life it is,&#8221; replied Mr. Bentley.
&#8220;The only way the apparatus can be carried is by
means of pack horses, and as each horse can&#8217;t
carry more than a hundred and fifty pounds you
see it takes quite a few of the animals to lug even
an ordinary amount of apparatus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The hardest part of the whole thing,&#8221; he went
on, warming to his recital as the boys were so
evidently interested, &#8220;was packing the cumbersome
storage batteries. These batteries were
often lost in transit, too. If a pack horse happened
to slip from the trail, its pack became
loosened and went tumbling down the mountain
side&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the life!&#8221; interrupted Jimmy gleefully,
and the visitor smiled at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might not think so if you happened to
be the one detailed to travel back over the almost
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
impassable trails for the missing apparatus,&#8221; observed
Mr. Bentley ruefully. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t all fun,
that pioneer installation of radio. Not by any
means.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But radio turned the trick just the same,&#8221;
said Bob slangily. &#8220;I&#8217;ve read that a message that
used to take two days to pass between ranger stations
can be sent now in a few seconds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Bentley, his eyes glinting.
&#8220;In a little while the saving in the cost of
forest fires will more than pay for the installation
of radio. We nose out a fire and send word by
wireless to the nearest station, before the fire
fairly knows it&#8217;s started.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But just what is it that you do?&#8221; asked Joe,
with flattering eagerness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do scout work,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I help
patrol the fire line in cases of bad fires. The men
fighting the fire generally carry a portable receiving
apparatus along with them, and by that means,
I, in my airplane, can report the progress of a fire
and direct the distribution of the men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be exciting work,&#8221; said Herb enviously.
&#8220;That&#8217;s just the kind of life I&#8217;d like&mdash;plenty
of adventure, something doing every
minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s usually plenty doing,&#8221; agreed Mr.
Bentley, with a likable grin. &#8220;We can&#8217;t complain
that our life is slow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I should think,&#8221; said Bob slowly, &#8220;that it
might be dangerous, installing sets right there in
the heavy timber.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what lots of radio engineers thought
also,&#8221; agreed Mr. Bentley. &#8220;But no such trouble
has developed so far, and I guess it isn&#8217;t likely
to now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t they have some trouble in getting
power enough for their sets?&#8221; asked Joe, with
interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that was a serious drawback in the beginning,&#8221;
came the answer. &#8220;They had to design
a special equipment&mdash;a sort of gasoline charging
plant. In this way they were able to secure
enough power for the charging of the storage
batteries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bob drew a long breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t I have liked to be the one to fit up
that first wireless station!&#8221; he cried enthusiastically.
&#8220;Just think how that Mr. Adams must have
felt when he received his first message through
the air.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t all fun,&#8221; the interesting visitor reminded
the boys. &#8220;The station was of the crudest
sort, you know. The first operator had a box to
sit on and another box served as the support for
his apparatus.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So much the better,&#8221; retorted Bob stoutly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
&#8220;A radio fan doesn&#8217;t know or care, half the time,
what he&#8217;s sitting on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which proves,&#8221; said Mr. Bentley, laughing,
&#8220;that you are a real one!&#8221; And at this all the
lads grinned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But say,&#8221; interrupted Joe, going back to the
problem of power, &#8220;weren&#8217;t the engineers able to
think up something to take the place of the gasoline
charging stations?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. But not without a good deal of experimenting.
Now they are using two hundred
and seventy number two Burgess dry batteries.
These, connecting in series, secure the required
three hundred and fifty-volt plate current.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>RADIO AND THE FIRE FIEND</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope that the boys know what you&#8217;re
talking about,&#8221; interrupted Mr. Layton at this
point, his eyes twinkling, &#8220;for I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They know what I&#8217;m talking about all right,&#8221;
returned his guest, admiration in his laughing
eyes as he looked at the boys. &#8220;Unless I miss my
guess, these fellows are the stuff of which radio
experts are made. I bet they&#8217;ll do great things
yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell us more about your experiences?&#8221;
begged Herb, while the other boys tried
not to look too pleased at the praise. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
often we have a chance to hear of adventures like
yours first hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Bentley, modestly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know that there&#8217;s much to tell. All we scouts do
is to patrol the country and watch for fires. Of
course, in case of a big fire, our duties are more
exciting. I remember one fire,&#8221; he leaned back
in his chair reminiscently and the boys listened
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
eagerly, hanging on every word. &#8220;It was a
beauty of its kind, covering pretty nearly fourteen
miles. Thousands of dollars&#8217; worth of valuable
timber was menaced. It looked for a time
as if it would get the better of us, at that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Men were scarce and there was a high wind
to urge the fire on. A receiving set was rushed
to the fire line, some of the apparatus in a truck
and some carried by truck horses. My plane was
detailed to patrol the fire line and give directions
to the men who were fighting the fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused, and the boys waited impatiently for
him to go on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The good old plane was equipped for both
sending and receiving, and I tell you we patrolled
that fourteen miles of flaming forest, sometimes
coming so close to the tree tops that we almost
seemed to brush them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My duty, of course, was to report the progress
of the fire. Controlled at one point, it broke out
at another, and it was through the messages from
my &#8217;plane to the ground set stationed just behind
the fire line that the men were moved from one
danger point to the next.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally, the fire seeming nearly out along
one side of the ridge, I sent the men to fighting it
on the other side, where it had been left to rage
uncontrolled. No sooner had the men scattered
for the danger point than the brooding fire broke
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
out again and it was necessary to recall half the
men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a long fight and a hard one, but with
the aid of the blessed old wireless, we finally won
out. As a matter of fact, the wireless-equipped
airplane has become as necessary to the Forest
Service as ships are to the navy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the old days,&#8221; he went on, seeing that the
boys were still deeply interested, &#8220;when they depended
upon the ordinary telephone to convey
warnings of fires they were surely leaning upon a
broken reed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Often, just when they needed the means of
communication most, the fire would sweep
through the woods, destroying trees to which the
telephone wires were fastened, and melting the
wires themselves. So the eyes of the Forest
Service were put out and they were forced to
work in the dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I should think,&#8221; protested Bob, &#8220;that
there would be times when even wireless would
be put out of the job. Suppose the fire were to
reach one of the stations equipped with wireless.
What then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Bentley laughed as though amused at
something.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can tell you an interesting incident connected
with that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And one that shows
the pluck and common sense of radio operators in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
general&mdash;don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m throwing bouquets
at myself, now, for first and last, I am a pilot,
even if sometimes I find it necessary to employ
radio.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, this operator that I am speaking
of, found himself in a perilous position. A
fire had been raging for days, and now it was so
close to his station that the station itself was
threatened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One morning when he got up the smoke from
the burning forest was swirling about the open
space in front of the station and he knew that
before long he would be seeing flame instead of
smoke. The fire fighters had been working ceaselessly,
fighting gallantly, but the elements were
against them. The air was almost as dry and
brittle as the wood which the flames lapped up
and there was a steady wind that drove the fire
on and on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If only there might come a fog or the wind
change its direction! But the radio man had no
intention of waiting on the elements. I don&#8217;t believe
he gave more than a passing thought to his
own safety&mdash;his chief interest was for the safety
of his beloved apparatus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He decided to dismantle the set, build a raft
and set himself and the apparatus adrift upon the
water in the attempt to save it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so he worked feverishly, while the fire
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
came closer and he could hear the men who were
fighting the fire shouting to each other. Finally
he succeeded in dismantling the set and got it
down to the water&#8217;s edge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here he built a rough raft, piled the apparatus
upon it, jumped after it, and drifted out into the
middle of the lake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the station burn down?&#8221; asked Jimmy
excitedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, fortunately. The wind died down in the
nick of time, giving the men a chance to control
the blaze. When it was evident the danger was
past, the operator set up his apparatus again and
prepared to continue his duties, as though nothing
had happened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There you have the tremendous advantage of
radio. There were no wires to be destroyed.
Only a radio set which could be dismantled and
taken to safety while the fire raged.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That operator sure had his nerve with him,
all right,&#8221; said Bob admiringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;More nerve than common sense perhaps,&#8221;
chuckled Mr. Bentley. &#8220;But you certainly can&#8217;t
help admiring him. He was right there when it
came to grit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After a while they began to discuss technicalities,
and the boys learned a great many things
they had never known before. The pilot happening
to mention that there were sometimes a number
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
of airplanes equipped with radio operating
within a restricted district, Joe wanted to know
if they did not have a good deal of trouble with
interference.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. There was at first some interference by
amateurs, but these soon learned to refrain from
using their instruments during patrol periods.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;we use a special type
of transmitting outfit aboard our fire-detection
craft. It&#8217;s called the SCR-Seventy-three. The
equipment obtains its power from a self-excited
inductor type alternator. This is propelled by
a fixed wooden-blade air fan. In the steam-line
casing of the alternator the rotary spark
gap, alternator, potential transformer, condenser
and oscillation transformer are self-contained.
Usually the alternator is mounted on the underside
of the fuselage where the propeller spends its
force in the form of an air stream. The telegraph
sending keys, field and battery switch, dry
battery, variometer and antenna reel are the only
units included inside the fuselage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The type of transmitter is a simple rotary gap,
indirectly excited spark and provided with nine
taps on the inductance coil of the closed oscillating
circuit. Five varying toothed discs for the
rotary spark gap yield five different signal tones
and nine different wave lengths are possible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; he finished, looking around at their absorbed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
faces, &#8220;you see it is quite possible to press
into service a number of airplanes without being
bothered by interference.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds complete,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;d like a
chance to see one of those sets at close range
sometime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The time passed so quickly that finally the
visitor rose with an apology for staying so late.
The radio boys were sorry to see him go. They
could have sat for hours more, listening to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow sure has had some experiences!&#8221;
said Joe, as, a little later, the boys mounted the
stairs to Bob&#8217;s room. &#8220;It was mighty lucky we
happened along while he was here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet your life,&#8221; said Herb. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
have missed meeting him for a lot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, fellows,&#8221; Jimmy announced from the
head of the stairs, &#8220;I know now what I&#8217;m going
to do when I&#8217;m through school. It&#8217;s me for the
tall timber. I&#8217;m going to pilot an airplane in the
service of my country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t he noble?&#8221; demanded Herb, grinning,
as the boys crowded into Bob&#8217;s room.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>NEAR DISASTER</h3>
</div>

<p>Several days later while the radio boys were
experimenting with their big set and talking over
their interesting meeting with the Forest Service
ranger, Herb displayed an immense horseshoe
magnet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look what he&#8217;s got for luck,&#8221; chortled Jimmy.
&#8220;The superstitious nut!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Superstitious nothing!&#8221; snorted Herb. &#8220;If
I&#8217;d wanted it for luck I wouldn&#8217;t have got a magnet,
would I? Any old common horseshoe would
have done for luck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the big idea?&#8221; asked Bob, looking
up from the audion tube he was experimenting
with. &#8220;Or is there any?&#8221; he added, with a
grin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet your life there is!&#8221; returned Herb.
&#8220;It&#8217;s got to do with that very audion tube you&#8217;re
fussing with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, go on,&#8221; jeered Joe, good-naturedly.
&#8220;What&#8217;s a magnet got to do with an audion tube,
I&#8217;d like to know!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old Herb,&#8221; added Jimmy, with a commiserating
shake of the head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, look here, all you fellows! Don&#8217;t you
go wasting any pity on me,&#8221; cried Herb hotly.
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t look out, I won&#8217;t show you my experiment
at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, Herb,&#8221; said Bob consolingly. &#8220;I&#8217;m
listening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad there&#8217;s one sensible member of
this bunch!&#8221; cried Herb, and from then on addressed
himself solely to Bob. &#8220;Look here,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You can make the audion tube ever so
much more sensitive to vibration if you put this
magnet near it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says so?&#8221; asked Bob, with interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. Here, put on the headphones and listen.
I&#8217;ll prove it to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bob obeyed and tuned in to the nearest broadcasting
station where a concert was scheduled.
As soon as he signified by a nod of his head that
the connection was satisfactory Herb placed the
big horseshoe magnet in such a position that the
poles of the magnet were on each side of the
tube.
</p>
<p>Sure enough, Bob was amazed at the almost
magical improvement in the sound. It was
clearer, more distinct, altogether more satisfactory.
He listened in for another moment then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
wonderingly took off the headphones while Herb
grinned at him in triumph.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think?&#8221; asked the latter
while Joe and Jimmy looked at them curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think?&#8221; repeated Bob, still wonderingly.
&#8220;Why, there&#8217;s only one thing to think, of course.
That fool horseshoe of yours, Herb, is one wonderful
improvement. I don&#8217;t know how it works,
but it surely is a marvel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Herb glanced at Jimmy and Joe in triumph.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I tell you?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Perhaps now
you&#8217;ll believe that my idea wasn&#8217;t such a fool one
after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what did it do, Bob?&#8221; asked Joe, mystified.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It increased the sensitivity of that old audion
tube, that&#8217;s what it did,&#8221; replied Bob, absently,
his mind already busy with inventive thoughts.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t see yet just how it accomplished it, but
the connection with the station was certainly
clearer and more distinct than usual.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can a magnet increase the sensitivity
of a vacuum tube?&#8221; asked Jimmy, not yet wholly
convinced. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make sense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t see why not,&#8221; contradicted Joe
slowly. &#8220;I suppose the improvement is due to the
magnetic effect of the magnet upon the electrons
flowing from the filament to the plate. I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
exactly see why it should be an improvement, but
if it is, then there must be some reason for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we could find the reason!&#8221; cried Bob
excitedly. &#8220;If we could make some improvement
upon the vacuum tube&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t wake him up, he is dreaming!&#8221; cried
Herb. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t look out, old boy, you&#8217;ll
have us all millionaires.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there are worse things,&#8221; retorted Bob,
taking the magnet from Herb&#8217;s hand and placing
it near the tube. &#8220;This has given us something
to think about, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a while they puzzled over the mystery, trying
to find some way in which the discovery
might be made to serve a practical purpose&mdash;all
except Herb, who retired to one corner of the
&#8220;lab&#8221; to fuss with some chemicals which he
fondly hoped might be used in the construction of
a battery.
</p>
<p>So engrossed were the boys in the problem of
the magnet and vacuum tube that they forgot all
about Herb and his experiments. So what happened
took them completely off their guard.
</p>
<p>There was a sudden cry from Herb, followed
closely by an explosion that knocked them off
their feet. For a moment they lay there, a bit
dazed by the shock. Then they scrambled to
their feet and looked about them. Herb, being
the nearest to the explosion, had got the worst of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
it. His face and hands were black and he was
shaking a little from the shock. He gazed at the
boys sheepishly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wh-what happened?&#8221; asked Jimmy dazedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An earthquake, I guess,&#8221; replied Bob, as he
looked about him to see what damage had been
done.
</p>
<p>Some doughnuts, which their namesake had recently
fetched from the store, lay scattered upon
the floor, together with some rather dilapidated-looking
pieces of candy, but aside from this, nothing
seemed to have been damaged seriously.
</p>
<p>Jimmy&#8217;s followed Bob&#8217;s gaze, and, finding his
precious sweets upon the floor, began gathering
them up hastily, stuffing a doughnut in his mouth
to help him hurry. What mattered it to Jimmy
that the floor was none too clean?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what&#8217;s the big idea, anyway,&#8221; Joe demanded
of the blackened Herb. &#8220;Trying to start
a Fourth of July celebration, or something?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just mixing some chemicals, and the result
was a flare-up,&#8221; explained Herb sulkily.
&#8220;Now, stop rubbing it into a fellow, will you?
You might know I didn&#8217;t do it on purpose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bob began to laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better get in connection with some soap and
water, Herb,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just now you look like
the lead for a minstrel show.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Herb,&#8221; Joe flung after the disconsolate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
scientist as he made for the door. &#8220;As
long as you don&#8217;t hurt anything but Jimmy&#8217;s
doughnuts, we don&#8217;t care. You can have as
many explosions as you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph, that&#8217;s all right for you,&#8221; retorted
Jimmy. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll have you know I spent my last
nickel for those doughnuts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same,&#8221; said Bob soberly, as they returned
to the problem of the vacuum tube, &#8220;we&#8217;re
mighty lucky to have come off with so little
damage. Mixing chemicals is a pretty dangerous
business unless you know just what you&#8217;re
doing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And even then it is,&#8221; added Joe.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A HAPPY INSPIRATION</h3>
</div>

<p>The days passed by, the boys becoming more
and more engrossed in the fascination of radio all
the time. They continued to work on their sets,
sometimes with the most gratifying results, at
others seeming to make little headway.
</p>
<p>But in spite of occasional discouragements they
worked on, cheered by the knowledge that they
were making steady, if sometimes slow, progress.
</p>
<p>There were so many really worth-while improvements
being perfected each day that they
really found it difficult to keep up with them all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish we could hear Cassey&#8217;s voice again,&#8221;
said Herb, one day when they had tuned in on
several more or less interesting personal messages.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what good it would do us,&#8221;
grumbled Joe. &#8220;If he speaks always in code he
could keep us guessing till doomsday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s up to some sort of mischief, anyway,&#8221;
said Bob; &#8220;and I, for one, would enjoy catching
him at it again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We would be more comfortable to have Dan
Cassey in jail, where he belongs,&#8221; observed
Jimmy.
</p>
<p>But just at present the trailing of that stuttering
voice seemed an impossible feat even for the
radio boys. If they could only get some tangible
clue to work on!
</p>
<p>They saw nothing of Buck Looker or his
cronies about town, and concluded that they were
still at the lumber camp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t stay away too long to suit me,&#8221; Bob
said cheerfully.
</p>
<p>It was about that time that Bob found out
about Adam McNulty. Adam McNulty was the
blind father of the washerwoman who served the
four families of the boys.
</p>
<p>Bob went to the McNulty cabin, buried in the
most squalid district of the town, bearing a message
from his mother. When he got there he
found that Mr. McNulty was the only one at
home.
</p>
<p>The old fellow, smoking a black pipe in the
bare kitchen of the house, seemed so pathetically
glad to see some one&mdash;or, rather, to hear some
one&mdash;that Bob yielded to his invitation to sit
down and talk to him.
</p>
<p>And, someway, even after Bob reached home,
he could not shake off the memory of the lonesome
old blind man with nothing to do all day
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
long but sit in a chair smoking his pipe, waiting
for some chance word from a passer-by.
</p>
<p>It did not seem fair that he, Bob, should have
all the good things of life while that old man
should have nothing&mdash;nothing, at all.
</p>
<p>He spoke to his chums about it, but, though
they were sympathetic, they did not see anything
they could do.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t give him back his eyesight, you
know,&#8221; said Joe absently, already deep in a new
scheme of improvement for the set.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;But we might give him
something that would do nearly as well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; they asked, puzzled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Radio,&#8221; said Bob, and laid his hand lovingly
on the apparatus. &#8220;If it means a lot to us, just
think how much more it would mean to some one
who hasn&#8217;t a thing to do all day but sit and think.
Why, I don&#8217;t suppose any of us who can see can
begin to realize what it would mean not to be able
even to read the daily newspaper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others stared at Bob, and slowly his meaning
sank home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I get you,&#8221; said Joe slowly. &#8220;And say, let
me tell you, it&#8217;s a great idea, Bob. It wouldn&#8217;t
be so bad to be blind if you could have the daily
news read to you every day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And listen to the latest on crops,&#8221; added
Jimmy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To say nothing of the latest jazz,&#8221; finished
Herb, with a grin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why doesn&#8217;t this blind man get himself
a set?&#8221; asked Jimmy practically. &#8220;I should
think every blind person in the country would
want to own one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose every one of them does,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;And Doctor Dale said the other day that he
thought the time would come when charities for
the blind would install radio as a matter of humanity,
and that prices of individual sets would
be so low that all the blind could afford them.
The blind are many of them old, you know, and
pretty poor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean,&#8221; said Herb slowly, &#8220;that most of
the blind folks who really need radio more than
anybody else can&#8217;t afford it? Say, that doesn&#8217;t
seem fair, does it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t fair!&#8221; cried Bob, adding, eagerly: &#8220;I
tell you what I thought we could do. There&#8217;s
that old set of mine! It doesn&#8217;t seem much to us
now, beside our big one, but I bet that McNulty
would think it was a gold mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray for Bob!&#8221; cried Herb irrepressibly.
&#8220;Once in a while he really does get a good idea
in his head. When do we start installing this
set in the McNulty mansion, boys?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as you like,&#8221; answered Bob. &#8220;Tomorrow&#8217;s
Saturday, so we could start early in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
morning. It will probably take us some time to
rig up the antenna.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys were enthusiastic about the idea, and
they wasted no time putting it into execution.
That very night they looked up the old set,
examining it to make sure it was in working
order.
</p>
<p>When they told their families what they proposed
to do, their parents were greatly pleased.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does my heart good,&#8221; said Mr. Layton to
his wife, after Bob had gone up to bed, &#8220;to see
that those boys are interested in making some one
besides themselves happy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going to make fine men, some day,&#8221;
answered Mrs. Layton softly.
</p>
<p>The boys arrived at the McNulty cottage so
early the next morning that they met Maggie
McNulty on her way to collect the day&#8217;s wash.
</p>
<p>When they told her what they were going to
do she was at first too astonished to speak and
then threatened to fall upon their necks in her
gratitude.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shure, if ye can bring some sunshine into my
poor old father&#8217;s dark life,&#8221; she told them in her
rich brogue, tears in her eyes, &#8220;then ye&#8217;ll shure
win the undyin&#8217; gratitude uv Maggie McNulty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a whole day&#8217;s job, and the boys worked
steadily, only stopping long enough to rush home
for a bit of lunch.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>They had tried to explain what they were doing
to Adam McNulty, but the old man seemed
almost childishly mystified. It was with a feeling
of dismay that the boys realized that, in all
probability, this was the first time the blind man
had ever heard the word radio. It seemed incredible
to them that there could be anybody in
the world who did not know about radio.
</p>
<p>However, if Adam McNulty was mystified, he
was also delightedly, pitifully excited. He followed
the boys out to the cluttered back yard
where they were rigging up the aerial, listening
eagerly to their chatter and putting in a funny
word now and then that made them roar with
laughter.
</p>
<p>Bob brought him an empty soap box for a seat
and there the old man sat hour after hour, despite
the fact that there was a chill in the air, blissfully
happy in their companionship. He had been
made to understand that something pleasant was
being done for him, but it is doubtful if he could
have asked for any greater happiness than just
to sit there with somebody to talk to and crack
his jokes with.
</p>
<p>They were good jokes too, full of real Irish
wit, and long before the set was ready for action
the boys had become fond of the old fellow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a dead game sport,&#8221; Joe said to Bob, in
that brief interval when they had raced home for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
lunch. &#8220;I bet I&#8217;d be a regular old crab, blind
like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Layton put up an appetizing lunch for the
blind man, topping it off with a delicious homemade
lemon pie and a thermos bottle full of
steaming coffee.
</p>
<p>The way the old man ate that food was amazing
even to Jimmy. Maggie was too busy earning
enough to keep them alive to bother much
with dainties. At any rate, Adam ate the entire
lemon pie, not leaving so much as a crumb.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I was pretty good on feeding,&#8221;
whispered Joe, in a delighted aside, &#8220;but I never
could go that old bird. He&#8217;s got me beat a
mile.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jimmy complacently, &#8220;I bet I&#8217;d tie
with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>If the boys had wanted any reward for that
day of strenuous work, they would have had it
when, placing the earphones upon his white head,
they watched the expression of McNulty&#8217;s face
change from mystification to wonder, then to
beatific enjoyment.
</p>
<p>He listened motionless while the exquisite
music flooded his starved old soul. Toward the
end he closed his eyes and tears trickled from beneath
the lids down his wrinkled face. He
brushed them off impatiently and the boys noticed
that his hand was trembling.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>It was a long, long time before he seemed to
be aware that there was any one in the room with
him. He seemed to have completely forgotten
the boys who had bestowed this rare gift upon
him.
</p>
<p>After a while, coming out of his dream, the
old man began fumbling with the headphones as
if he wanted to take them off, and Bob helped
him. The man tried to speak, but made hard
work of it. Emotion choked him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shure, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t know what to make of it
at all, at all,&#8221; he said at last, in a quivering voice.
&#8220;Shure an&#8217; I thought the age of miracles was
passed. I&#8217;m only an ignorant old man, with no
eyes at all; but you lads have given me something
that&#8217;s near as good. Shure an&#8217; it&#8217;s an old sinner
I am, for shure. Many&#8217;s the day I&#8217;ve sat here,
prayin&#8217; the Lord would give me wan more minute
o&#8217; sight before I died, an&#8217; it was unanswered my
prayers wuz, I thought. It&#8217;s grateful I am to
yez, lads. It&#8217;s old Adam McNulty&#8217;s blessin&#8217; ye&#8217;ll
always have. An&#8217; now will yez put them things
in my ears? It&#8217;s heaven&#8217;s own angels I&#8217;d like to
be hearin&#8217; agin. That&#8217;s the lad&mdash;ah!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And while the beatific expression stole once
more over his blind old face the boys stole silently
out.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE ESCAPED CONVICT</h3>
</div>

<p>The boys saw a good deal of Adam McNulty
in the days that followed, and the change in the
old man was nothing short of miraculous.
</p>
<p>He no longer sat in the bare kitchen rocking
and smoking his pipe, dependent upon some
passer-by for his sole amusement. He had radio
now, and under the instruction of the boys he had
become quite expert in managing the apparatus.
Although he had no eyes, his fingers were extraordinarily
sensitive and they soon learned to
handle the set intelligently.
</p>
<p>His daughter Maggie, whose gratitude to the
boys knew no bounds, looked up the radio program
in the paper each day and carefully instructed
her father as to just when the news reports
were given out, the story reading, concerts,
and so forth.
</p>
<p>And so the old blind man lived in a new world&mdash;or
rather, the old world which he had ceased to
live in when he became blind&mdash;and he seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
actually to grow younger day by day. For radio
had become his eyes.
</p>
<p>Doctor Dale heard of this act of kindness on
the part of the boys and he was warm in his
praise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Radio,&#8221; he told the boys one day when he met
them on the street, &#8220;is a wonderful thing for
those of us that can see, but for the blind it is
a miracle. You boys have done an admirable
thing in your kindness to Adam McNulty, and I
hope that, not only individuals, but the government
itself will see the possibilities of so great a
charity and follow your example.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys glowed with pride at the doctor&#8217;s
praise, and then and there made the resolve that
whenever they came across a blind person that
person should immediately possess a radio set if
it lay within their power to give it to him.
</p>
<p>On this particular day when so many things
happened the boys were walking down Main
Street, talking as usual of their sets and the
marvelous progress of radio.
</p>
<p>Although it was still early spring, the air was
as warm almost as it would be two months later.
There was a smell of damp earth and pushing
grass in the air, and the boys, sniffing hungrily,
longed suddenly for the freedom of the open
country.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck and his bunch have it all their own
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
way,&#8221; said Herb discontentedly. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
mind being up in a lumber camp myself just
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too early for the country yet,&#8221; said Jimmy
philosophically. &#8220;Probably be below zero to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What you thinking about, Bob?&#8221; asked Joe,
noticing that his chum had been quiet for some
time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking,&#8221; said Bob, coming out of his
reverie, &#8220;of the difference there has been in generators
since the early days of Marconi&#8217;s spark
coil. First we had the spark transmitters and
then we graduated to transformers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And they still gave us the spark,&#8221; added Joe,
taking up the theme. &#8220;Then came the rotary
spark gap and later the Goldsmith generator&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; Jimmy continued cheerfully, &#8220;the
Goldsmith generator was knocked into a cocked
hat by the Alexanderson generator.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have an improvement on that before
long, too,&#8221; prophesied Herb.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They have already,&#8221; Bob took him up quickly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember what Doctor Dale told us
of the new power vacuum tube where one tube
can take care of fifty K. W.?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee,&#8221; breathed Herb admiringly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll say
that&#8217;s some energy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those same vacuum tubes are being built
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
right now,&#8221; went on Bob enthusiastically. &#8220;They
are made of quartz and are much cheaper than
the alternators we&#8217;re using now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are small too, compared to our present-day
generators,&#8221; added Joe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet!&#8221; agreed Bob, adding, as his eyes
narrowed dreamily: &#8220;All the apparatus seems to
be growing smaller these days, anyway. I bet
before we fellows are twenty years older, engineers
will have done away altogether with large
power plants and cumbersome machinery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I read the other day,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;that before
long all the apparatus needed, even for transatlantic
stations, can be contained in a small room
about twenty-five feet by twenty-five.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what shall we do for power?&#8221; protested
Herb. &#8220;We&#8217;ll always have to have generators.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any such word as &#8216;always&#8217; in
radio,&#8221; returned Bob. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if in
the next twenty or thirty years we shall be able,
by means of appliances like this new power
vacuum tube, to get our power from the ordinary
lighting circuit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that would do away entirely with generators,&#8221;
added Joe triumphantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wouldn&#8217;t say anything was impossible,&#8221;
said Herb doubtfully. &#8220;But that seems to
me like a pretty large order.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a large order,&#8221; agreed Bob, adding with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
conviction: &#8220;But it isn&#8217;t too large for radio to
fill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking of lodging all apparatus in one fair-sized
room,&#8221; Joe went on. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why that
can&#8217;t really be done in a few years. Why, they
say that this new power vacuum tube which
handles fifty K. W. is not any larger than a desk
drawer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see the day of the vest-pocket radio set coming
nearer and nearer, according to you fellows,&#8221;
announced Herb. &#8220;Pretty soon we&#8217;ll be getting
our apparatus so small we&#8217;ll need a microscope to
see it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Laugh if you want to,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;But I bet
in the next few years we&#8217;re going to see greater
things done in radio than have been accomplished
yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s saying something!&#8221; exclaimed Joe,
with a laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; said Jimmy thoughtfully, &#8220;that there
have been more changes in a short time in radio
than in any other science.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so!&#8221; Herb took him up. &#8220;Look
at telephone and telegraph and electric lighting
systems. There have been changes in them, of
course, but beside the rapid-fire changes of radio,
they seem to have been standing still.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There haven&#8217;t been any changes to speak of
in the electric lighting systems for the last fifteen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
years or more,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;And the telephone
has stayed just about the same, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt about it,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;Radio
has got &#8217;em all beat as far as a field for experiment
is concerned. Say,&#8221; he added fervently,
&#8220;aren&#8217;t you glad you weren&#8217;t born a hundred
years ago?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys stopped in at Adam McNulty&#8217;s cabin
to see how the old fellow was getting along.
They found him in the best of spirits and, after
&#8220;listening in&#8221; with him for a while and laughing
at some of his Irish jokes, they started toward
home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;that we could have gotten
a line on Dan Cassey. It seems strange that we
haven&#8217;t been able to pick up some real clue in all
this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For, although the boys had caught several other
mysterious messages uttered in the stuttering
voice of Dan Cassey, they had not been able to
make head nor tail of them. The lads liked
mysteries, but they liked them chiefly for the fun
of solving them. And they seemed no nearer to
solving this one than they had been in the beginning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s a fool idea,&#8221; said Herb sheepishly.
&#8220;But since we were the ones that got Cassey his
jail sentence before, I kind of feel as if we were
responsible for him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty lucky for us we&#8217;re not,&#8221; remarked
Joe. &#8220;We certainly would be up against it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On and on the boys went. Presently Joe began
to whistle and all joined in until suddenly Jimmy
uttered a cry and went down on his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; questioned Bob, leaping
to his chum&#8217;s side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tripped on a tree root,&#8221; growled Doughnuts,
rising slowly. &#8220;Gosh! what a spill I had.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better look where you are going,&#8221; suggested
Herb.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why they can&#8217;t chop off some of
these roots, so it&#8217;s better walking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;you come down and do the chopping,&#8221;
returned Joe, lightly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much! The folks that own the woods
can do that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t find fault, Jimmy. Remember, some
of these very roots have furnished us with shinny
sticks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not the one I tripped over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was some time later that the boys noticed
that they had tramped further than they had intended.
They were on the very outskirts of the
town, and before them the heavily-wooded region
stretched invitingly.
</p>
<p>Jimmy, who, on account of his plumpness, was
not as good a hiker as the other boys, was for
turning back, but the other three wanted to go on.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
And, being three against one, Jimmy had not the
shadow of a chance of getting his own way.
</p>
<p>It was cool in the shadows of the woods, and
the boys were reminded that it was still early in
the season. It was good to be in the woods, just
the same, and they tramped on for a long way
before they finally decided it was time to turn
back.
</p>
<p>They were just about to turn around when
voices on the path ahead of them made them hesitate.
As they paused three men came into full
view, and the boys stood, staring.
</p>
<p>Two of the men they had never seen before,
but the other they knew well. It was the man
whose voice they had been trailing all these weeks&mdash;Dan
Cassey, the stutterer!

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>DOWN THE TRAP DOOR</h3>
</div>

<p>It seemed that in the semi-darkness of the
woods Cassey did not at once recognize the
radio boys. He was talking excitedly to his
companions in his stuttering tongue and he was
almost upon the boys before he realized who they
were.
</p>
<p>He stopped still, eyes and mouth wide open.
Then, with a stuttered imprecation, he turned and
fled. The men with him stayed not to question,
but darted furtively into the woods.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, fellows!&#8221; cried Bob, with a whoop
of delight. &#8220;Here&#8217;s where we nail Dan Cassey,
sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys, except poor Jimmy, were unusually
fleet, and they soon overtook Cassey. Bob&#8217;s
hand was almost upon him when the man doubled
suddenly in his tracks and darted off into the
thick underbrush.
</p>
<p>Bob, with Herb and Joe close at his heels, was
after him in a minute. He reached a clearing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
just in time to see Cassey dash into an old barn
which had been hidden by the trees.
</p>
<p>The boys plunged into the barn with Jimmy
pantingly bringing up the rear. In Bob&#8217;s heart
was a wild exultation. They had Cassey cornered.
Once more they would bring this criminal
to justice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You guard the door,&#8221; he called in a low tone
to Joe. &#8220;See that Cassey doesn&#8217;t get out that
way, and Herb and I will get after him in
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The barn was so dark that they could hardly
see to move around. There was a window high
up in the side wall, but this was so covered with
dirt and cobwebs that it was almost as though
there was none.
</p>
<p>However, Cassey must be lurking in one of
those dark corners, and if they moved carefully
they were sure to capture him!
</p>
<p>There was a loft to the barn, but if there had
been a ladder leading up to it it had long since
rotted and dropped away, so that Bob was reasonably
sure the man could not be up there.
</p>
<p>It was eery business, groping about in the
musty darkness of the old barn for a man who
would go to almost any lengths of villainy to
keep from being caught.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Bob saw something move, and, with
an exultant yell, jumped toward it. Once more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
he almost had his hand upon Cassey when&mdash;something
happened.
</p>
<p>The floor of the barn seemed to open and let
him through, and his chums with him. As he
fell through the hole into blackness he had confused
thoughts of an earthquake. Then he
struck bottom with a solid thump that almost
made him see stars.
</p>
<p>He heard similar thumps about him and realized
that Herb and Jimmy had followed him. Whatever
it was they had shot through had evidently
magically closed up again, for they were in absolute
darkness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; came in a voice which Bob recognized
as Jimmy&#8217;s, &#8220;I must say, this is a nice note!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been pushed off the end of the world,
I guess,&#8221; said Herb, with a sorry attempt at humor.
&#8220;Who all&#8217;s in this party anyway? Are
we all here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; said Joe, and at the sound of his
voice Bob jumped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I
thought you were going to guard the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I should have done, but I played
the big idiot,&#8221; retorted Joe bitterly. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t
resist coming after you fellows to be in on the
big fight. I suppose while I was trailing you
boys somebody sneaked in the door and signed
our finish.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like it,&#8221; said Bob, feeling himself to
make sure there were no bones broken. &#8220;And
now, instead of delivering Cassey to justice we&#8217;re
prisoners ourselves. Say, I bet the old boy isn&#8217;t
laughing at us or anything just now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awful sorry, Bob,&#8221; said Joe penitently.
&#8220;I thought if I kept my eye on the door&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Bob generously. &#8220;Accidents
will happen and there&#8217;s no use crying over
spilled milk. I suppose the most sensible thing
for us to do right now is to hustle around and
find a way out of this place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe there isn&#8217;t any,&#8221; said Jimmy dolefully.
&#8220;Then what&#8217;ll we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay here and let the rats eat us, I guess,&#8221;
said Herb cheerfully, and Jimmy groaned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, don&#8217;t talk about eating, old boy,&#8221; he
pleaded. &#8220;I&#8217;m just about starved this minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll probably stay starved for some little
time longer,&#8221; said Bob unfeelingly. He had
risen cautiously to his feet, and finding that their
prison was at least high enough for them to stand
up in, reached his hands tentatively above his
head.
</p>
<p>As, even by standing on tiptoe, his fingers encountered
nothing but air, he decided that they
must have dropped further than he had thought
at the time.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>A hand reached out and took hold of him and
he realized that Joe was standing beside him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Must have been some sort of trap door opening
inward, I guess,&#8221; said the latter. &#8220;You
didn&#8217;t see anything, did you, Bob?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It happened too suddenly. One minute
I was reaching forward to grab hold of Cassey
and the next moment I found myself flying
through space.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph,&#8221; grunted Joe. &#8220;It was lucky for
Cassey that we all happened to be in a bunch,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;He couldn&#8217;t have gotten rid of us so
quickly if we&#8217;d been scattered about&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As we should have been,&#8221; added Bob. &#8220;Just
the same,&#8221; he added, after a minute, &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose
it would have done any good if one of us
had been left up there. It must have been the
men who were with Cassey who sprang the trap
on us; and if that&#8217;s so, the fight would have been
three to one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have tried it just the same,&#8221; said
Joe belligerently. &#8220;I bet Cassey would have
got a black eye out of it, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For some time they groped around the black
hole of their prison, hoping to find some way of
escape, but without success. They were beginning
to get tired and discouraged, and they sat
down on the floor to talk the situation over.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>The queer thing about this hole in the ground
was that it possessed a flooring where one would
have expected to find merely packed-down dirt.
The flooring consisted of rough boards laid side
by side, and when the boys moved upon it it
sounded like the rattling of some rickety old
bridge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some mystery about this place,&#8221; said
Bob. &#8220;I bet this is a regular meeting place for
Cassey and whoever his confederates may be. In
case of pursuit all they would have to do would
be to hide in this hole and they&#8217;d be practically
safe from discovery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Herb, &#8220;why Cassey didn&#8217;t do
that now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably didn&#8217;t have time,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I
was right on his heels, you know, and probably he
didn&#8217;t dare stop for anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so they turned the trick on us,&#8221; said Joe.
&#8220;And it sure was a neat job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too neat, if we don&#8217;t get out of here soon,&#8221;
groaned Jimmy. &#8220;I bet they&#8217;ve just left us here
to starve!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t put it beyond Cassey,&#8221; said Herb
gloomily. &#8220;It would be just the kind of thing
he&#8217;d love to do. He&#8217;s got a grudge against us,
anyway, for doing him out of Miss Berwick&#8217;s
money and landing him in jail, and this would
be a fine way to get even.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s his game, he&#8217;s got another
guess coming,&#8221; said Bob, adding excitedly:
&#8220;Say, fellows, if that was a trap door that let us
down into this hole, and it must have been something
of that sort, we&#8217;ll probably be able to get
out the same way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s above our heads,&#8221; protested Herb.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What difference does that make?&#8221; returned
Bob impatiently. &#8220;One of us can stand on the
other&#8217;s back, and we can haul the last fellow out
by his hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Simple when you say it quick,&#8221; said Joe
gloomily. &#8220;But I bet that trap door is bolted on
the outside. You don&#8217;t think Cassey&#8217;s going to
let us off that easy, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we could see anyway,&#8221; returned Bob.
&#8220;Anything&#8217;s better than just sitting here. Come
on, let&#8217;s find that trap door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This feat, in itself, was no easy one. They
had wandered about in the dark so much that they
had become completely confused.
</p>
<p>Since Herb was the slightest, he was hoisted
up on Bob&#8217;s shoulders and they began the stumbling
tour of their prison. It seemed ages before
Herb&#8217;s glad cry announced a discovery of some
sort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found a handle,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Steady there,
Bob, till I give it a pull.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<a name='XII_GROPING_IN_DARKNESS' id='XII_GROPING_IN_DARKNESS'></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>GROPING IN DARKNESS</h3>
</div>

<p>Herb tugged gently and gave another yell of
delight when whatever was attached to the handle
yielded grudgingly to the pull.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the trap door, fellows!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Move
over a bit, Bob, till I pull the thing down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bob, who, about this time, was finding Herb&#8217;s
weight not any too comfortable, moved over, and,
in doing so, stumbled, nearly pitching himself and
Herb to the floor.
</p>
<p>As it was, Herb lost his balance and leaped
wildly. He landed on his feet and reached out
a hand to find Bob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of all the tough luck,&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;There
I had the thing in my hand and now we&#8217;ve gone
and lost it again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry. But stop your groaning and get
busy,&#8221; Bob commanded him. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t moved
from this spot, so if you get up on my shoulders
again you ought to be able to get hold of the
handle easily enough.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>So, hoisted and pushed by Joe and Jimmy,
Herb finally regained his perch and felt for the
handle. He found it, and this time pulled the
door so far open that the boys could see through
the opening in the barn floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If somebody can hold that door,&#8221; panted
Herb, &#8220;I think I can get through this hole. Grab
hold, boy. It sure is heavy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Joe caught the door as it swung downward
and Herb scrambled through the aperture. Bob
gave a grunt of relief as the weight was taken
from his shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re next, Joe,&#8221; Bob was saying when
Jimmy came stumbling up, carrying something
that banged against Bob&#8217;s legs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it,&#8221; he panted. &#8220;Had an idea I
might find something like it. Trust your Uncle
Jimmy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For the love of butter, what are you raving
about?&#8221; interrupted Joe, and Jimmy proudly exhibited
his prize.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A soap box,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And a good big one,
too. If we stand on that we can reach the opening
easily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, Doughnuts,&#8221; cried Bob, joyfully
seizing upon the soap box. &#8220;This beats
playing the human footstool all hollow. Jump
up on it, Jimmy, and see how quick you can get
out of here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>Jimmy needed no second invitation. He
scrambled up on the tall box, and by stretching
up on tip toe could just manage to get his fingers
over the edge of the flooring above.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a boost, some one,&#8221; he commanded,
and Bob obligingly administered the boost.
</p>
<p>Joe was next. Bob went last, holding the trap
door with his foot to keep it from closing too
quickly. Once upon the floor of the barn he
took his foot away and the door banged to with
a snap, being balanced by a rope and weight
above.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s that!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, eyeing the
closed door with satisfaction. &#8220;If Cassey
thought he was going to fool us long, he sure was
mistaken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s hiding around here somewhere,&#8221;
suggested Herb, lowering his voice to a whisper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No such luck,&#8221; replied Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;d be willing
to wager that the moment we struck bottom there,
Cassey and his friends beat it away from here as
fast as their legs could take them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d better look around a
little bit, anyway?&#8221; suggested Joe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do any harm,&#8221; agreed Bob. &#8220;But
first let&#8217;s have a look outside. We don&#8217;t want
to overlook any clues.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys thrashed around the bushes about the
barn until they were satisfied no one was hiding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
there and then returned to the barn. They were
curious to find out just how they had been shot
through that trap door.
</p>
<p>They thought at first that it was perhaps
worked by some sort of apparatus, but they found
that this was not the case. They found by experimenting
that the trap door yielded easily to
their weight, and decided that it had been their
combined rush upon Cassey that had done the
trick. The weight of the four of them upon it
had shot the door down so rapidly that they had
not had time even to know what was happening
to them, much less scramble to safety. Then it
had shut on them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t have worked better for them,&#8221;
said Herb, as they turned toward the door of the
barn. &#8220;I bet they&#8217;re laughing yet at the way
they put things over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em laugh,&#8221; said Bob, adding fiercely:
&#8220;But I bet you anything that the last laugh will
be ours!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what Cassey was doing here, anyway,&#8221;
said Jimmy, as they walked slowly homeward.
&#8220;It was lucky, wasn&#8217;t it, that we happened
along when we did?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see where it&#8217;s so lucky,&#8221; grumbled Joe.
&#8220;We&#8217;re no nearer catching him now than we ever
were.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Except that we know he&#8217;s around this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
locality,&#8221; put in Bob. &#8220;I guess the police will be
glad to know that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! are you going to tell the police?&#8221; asked
Jimmy, whose thoughts had been upon what he
was going to get for dinner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;He&#8217;s an escaped
criminal, and it&#8217;s up to us to tell the police all we
know about him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wish we knew more to tell,&#8221; said Joe
disconsolately.
</p>
<p>Since they had been flung through the trap
door, Joe had called himself every unpleasant
name he could think of for his carelessness. If
he had stayed at the door where he belonged,
there would have been one of them left to grapple
with Dan Cassey. Probably the two men who
had been with Cassey when they had surprised
him had not been anywhere around. They belonged
to the type of criminal that always thinks
of its own safety first. Probably they had not
been anywhere near the barn. And if it had been
only Dan Cassey and himself, well, he, Joe, could
at least have given the scoundrel a black eye&mdash;maybe
captured him.
</p>
<p>He said something of this to his chums, but
they laughed at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop your grouching,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t
we already agreed that there&#8217;s no use crying over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
spilled milk? And, anyway, you just watch out.
We&#8217;ll get Cassey yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As soon as the boys reached town they went
straight to the police station and told the story
of their encounter with Cassey to the grizzled old
chief, who nodded his head grimly and thanked
them for the information.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send some men out right away,&#8221; he told
them. &#8220;If there&#8217;s a criminal in those woods,
they&#8217;re sure to get him before dark. It&#8217;s too bad
you lads couldn&#8217;t have got him yourselves. It
would sure have been a feather in your caps!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t he rub it in?&#8221; grumbled Joe,
as they turned at last toward home and dinner.
&#8220;He ought to know we feel mad enough about
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;if the police round him up,
because of our information, it will be almost as
good as though we&#8217;d caught him ourselves. I
wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; he added, with a glint in his eye, &#8220;exactly
like to be in Cassey&#8217;s shoes, now.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>CUNNING SCOUNDRELS</h3>
</div>

<p>But, contrary to the expectations of the radio
boys, the police were not able to locate Cassey nor
any of the rest of the gang. They searched the
woods for miles around the old barn about which
the boys had told them, even carrying their search
into the neighboring townships, but without any
result. It seemed as though the earth had opened
and swallowed up Cassey together with his rascally
companions. If such a thing had actually
happened, their disappearance could not have been
more complete.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They must be experts in the art of hiding,&#8221;
grumbled Bob, upon returning from a visit to the
chief of police. &#8220;I was certain they would be
rounded up before this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess they must have made a break for the
tall timber,&#8221; said Joe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Decided, maybe, it isn&#8217;t just healthy around
here,&#8221; added Herb, with a grin.
</p>
<p>And then, just when they had decided that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
Cassey and his gang had made a masterly getaway,
the radio boys got on their trail once again.
</p>
<p>That very evening, when tuning in for the concert,
they caught another of those mysterious,
stuttering messages in the unmistakable voice of
Dan Cassey!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rice, rats, make hay,&#8221; was the substance of
this message, and the boys would have laughed if
they had not been so dumbfounded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about that?&#8221; gasped
Jimmy. &#8220;That old boy sure has his nerve with
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re still hanging around here somewhere!&#8221;
cried Bob excitedly. &#8220;They&#8217;ve probably
got a hiding place that even the police can&#8217;t find.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if we could only make sense of this!&#8221; exclaimed
Herb, staring at the apparently senseless
message which he had written down. &#8220;If we
only had their code the whole thing would be
simple.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, if we only had a million dollars, we&#8217;d
be millionaires!&#8221; retorted Jimmy scornfully.
&#8220;Where do you get that stuff, anyway?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bob, temporarily giving up the
problem, &#8220;as far as I can see, all there is for us
to do is to keep our eyes and ears open and trust
to luck. Now what do you say we listen in on
the concert for a little while?&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the days that followed Cassey&#8217;s voice came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
to them several times out of the ether, and always
in that same cryptic form that, try as they would,
they could not make out.
</p>
<p>It was exasperating, that familiar voice coming
to them out of the air day after day without
giving them the slightest clue to the whereabouts
of the speaker.
</p>
<p>And then, while they were in town one day,
they quite unexpectedly ran into their old friend,
Frank Brandon, the wireless inspector, whose
work for some time had taken him into another
district.
</p>
<p>However, he was to stay in Clintonia for a few
days on business now, and since he had nothing
particular to do that day, Bob enthusiastically invited
him up to his home for a visit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you can give us some tips on our set,&#8221;
Bob added, as Mr. Brandon readily accepted the
invitation. &#8220;We&#8217;re not altogether satisfied with
our batteries. For some reason or other they
burn out too quickly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll take a look at it,&#8221; agreed Mr. Brandon
good-naturedly. &#8220;Although I imagine you
boys are such experts by this time I can&#8217;t tell you
very much. What have you been doing with
yourselves since we last met?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys told him something of their experiences,
in which he showed intense interest, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
in return he told them some interesting things that
had happened to him.
</p>
<p>And when he spoke of catching mysterious
messages in the stuttering voice of Dan Cassey,
Bob broke in upon him eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve caught a good many such messages
too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Have you managed to make anything
of them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing,&#8221; said Mr. Brandon, shaking his
head. &#8220;If it is a criminal code, and I am about
assured that it is, then it is a remarkably clever
one and one that it is almost impossible to decipher
without a key. I&#8217;ve just about given up
trying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the boys told of their encounter with
Cassey in the woods and their adventure in the
old barn, and Frank Brandon was immensely excited.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the man is up to his old
tricks again! I&#8217;d like to get hold of him before
he does any serious harm. That sort of criminal
is a menace to the community.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The funny part of it,&#8221; he continued, as they
turned the corner into Bob&#8217;s block, &#8220;is that these
messages are not all in Cassey&#8217;s voice. Have you
noticed that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the boys&#8217; turn to be surprised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a new one on us,&#8221; Bob confessed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
&#8220;The only messages we have caught so far have
been in Cassey&#8217;s voice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Frank Brandon slowly shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have caught a couple in a
strange voice, a voice I never heard before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same kind of message?&#8221; asked Herb
eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same kind of message,&#8221; Brandon
affirmed. &#8220;I have taken it for granted that the
owner of the strange voice is a confederate of
Cassey&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe one of the fellows who was with him
in the woods,&#8221; said Jimmy, and Mr. Brandon
nodded gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, of
course, but I imagine that there are several in
Cassey&#8217;s gang.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time they had reached Bob&#8217;s home, and
as it was nearly lunch time, Mrs. Layton insisted
that they all stay to lunch. The boys, not liking
to make her trouble, said they would go home and
come back later, but the lady of the house would
have none of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, all of you,&#8221; she commanded, in her
cheerful, hospitable way. &#8220;I know you&#8217;re starved&mdash;all
but Jimmy&mdash;&#8221; this last with a smile, &#8220;and
there&#8217;s plenty to eat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Frank Brandon was very entertaining all during
the meal and kept them in gales of laughter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
Mrs. Layton found him as amusing as did the
boys.
</p>
<p>At last the lunch came to an end and Mr.
Brandon professed himself ready to talk shop.
</p>
<p>He was enthusiastic over the radio set the boys
showed him and declared that he could see very
little improvement to suggest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You surely have kept up with the march,&#8221; he
said admiringly. &#8220;You have pretty nearly all the
latest appliances, haven&#8217;t you? Good work,
boys. Keep it up and you&#8217;ll be experts in
earnest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could only find some way to lengthen
the life of our storage batteries,&#8221; said Bob, not
without a pardonable touch of pride, &#8220;we wouldn&#8217;t
have much to complain about. But that battery
does puzzle us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your battery filled with water and see if
it doesn&#8217;t last you about twice as long,&#8221; suggested
the radio expert. &#8220;Don&#8217;t add any acid to your
battery, for it&#8217;s only the water that evaporates.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will that really do the trick?&#8221; asked Joe,
wondering. &#8220;I don&#8217;t just see how&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does just the same,&#8221; Brandon interrupted
confidently. &#8220;All you have to do is to try it to
find out. Don&#8217;t use ordinary water though. It
needs to be distilled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a new one on me, all right,&#8221; said Bob,
adding gratefully: &#8220;But we&#8217;re obliged for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
information. If distilled water will lengthen the
life of our battery, then distilled water it shall
have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems queer,&#8221; said Mr. Brandon reflectively,
&#8220;how apparently simple things will work immense
improvement. Marconi, for instance, by merely
shortening his wave length, is discovering wonderful
things. We cannot even begin to calculate
what marvelous things are in store for us
when we begin to send out radio waves of a few
centimeters, perhaps less. We have not yet explored
the low wave lengths, and when we do
I believe we are in for some great surprises.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Joe, as he paused. &#8220;Tell us
more about these low wave lengths.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A DARING HOLDUP</h3>
</div>

<p>Frank Brandon shook his head and smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t know much more to tell,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;As I have said, what will happen when
we materially decrease the wave length, is still in
the land of conjecture. But I tell you,&#8221; he added,
with sudden enthusiasm, &#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad to be
living in this good old age. What we have already
seen accomplished is nothing to what we are going
to see. Why,&#8221; he added, &#8220;some scientists, Steinmetz,
for instance, are even beginning to claim
that ether isn&#8217;t the real medium for the propagation
of radio waves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; asked Bob, with
interest. &#8220;Is it some sort of joke?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Joke, nothing!&#8221; replied Frank Brandon. &#8220;As
a matter of fact, I fully believe that electro-magnetic
waves can as easily be hurled through a void
as through ether.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys were silent for a moment, thinking
this over. It sounded revolutionary, but they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
had great respect for Frank Brandon&#8217;s judgment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the Rogers underground aerial,&#8221; Bob
suggested tentatively, and Brandon took him up
quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; he said. &#8220;That leans in the direction
of what I say. Why, I believe the day is
coming&mdash;and it isn&#8217;t so very far in the future,
either&mdash;when no aerial will be used.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I believe,&#8221; he added, becoming more and
more enthusiastic as he continued, &#8220;that ten years
from now we shall simply attach our receiving
outfits to the ground and shall be able to receive
even more satisfactorily than we do to-day.&#8221; He
laughed and added lightly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;But who am I to assume the rôle of prophet?
Perhaps, like a good many prophets, I see too
much in the future that never will come true.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t
wonder if all your prophesy will come true in a few
years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Herb, with a grin, &#8220;it will be a relief
not to get any more broken shins putting up
aerials.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Brandon laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been there myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you read about that radio-controlled
tank?&#8221; Joe asked. &#8220;The one that was exhibited
in Dayton, I mean?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I not only read about it, I saw it,&#8221; Mr. Brandon
answered, and the boys stared at him in surprise.
&#8220;I happened to be there on business,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;and you can better believe I was on hand
when they rolled that tank through the traffic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did it look like?&#8221; asked Jimmy eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The car was about eight feet long and three
feet high,&#8221; responded Brandon. &#8220;It was furnished
with a motor and storage batteries, and I
guess its speed was about five or six miles an
hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And was it really controlled by radio?&#8221; put in
Herb, wishing that he had been on the spot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; returned Brandon. &#8220;An automobile
followed along behind it and controlled it
entirely by wireless signals. The apparatus that
does all the work is called the selector, and it&#8217;s only
about the size of a saucer. It decodes the dots
and dashes and obeys the command in an inconceivably
short time&mdash;about a quarter of a second.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can be controlled by an airplane, too, can&#8217;t
it?&#8221; asked Bob, and the radio inspector nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In case of war,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;I imagine
these airplane-controlled tanks could do considerable
damage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Their guest left soon after that, and, of course,
the boys were sorry to have him go. His last
words to them were about Cassey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your eyes open for that scoundrel,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
said, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll find out what he&#8217;s up to yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But in the next few days so many alarming
things happened that the boys had little time to
think about Dan Cassey. The alarming happenings
consisted of a series of automobile robberies
in neighboring towns, robberies committed so
skillfully that no hint nor clue was given of the
identity of the robbers.
</p>
<p>And then the robberies came nearer home, even
into Clintonia itself. The president of one of
the banks left his machine outside the bank for
half an hour, and when he came out again it was
gone. No one could remember seeing any suspicious
characters around.
</p>
<p>Then Raymond Johnston, a prominent business
man of the town, had his car taken in the
same mysterious manner from in front of his
home. As before, no one could give the slightest
clue as to the identity of the thieves.
</p>
<p>The entire community was aroused and the
police were active, and yet the mystery remained
as dark as ever.
</p>
<p>Then, one day, Herb came dashing over to
Bob&#8217;s home in a state of wild excitement. Joe
and Jimmy were already there, and Herb stopped
not even for a greeting before he sprang his news.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, fellows!&#8221; he cried, sprawling in a chair
and panting after his run, &#8220;it&#8217;s time somebody
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
caught those auto thieves. They are getting a
little too personal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; they demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of dad&#8217;s trucks has been held up!&#8221; gasped
Herb. &#8220;In broad daylight, too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was anything taken?&#8221; asked Joe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything? Well, I should say! They looted
the truck of everything. It&#8217;s a wonder they didn&#8217;t
steal the machinery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a pretty big loss for your dad, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
said Bob gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is!&#8221; replied Herb, running his fingers
through his hair. &#8220;He&#8217;s all cut up about it and
vows he&#8217;ll catch the ruffians. Though he&#8217;ll have
to be a pretty clever man if he does, I&#8217;ll say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They do seem to be pretty slick,&#8221; agreed Bob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if the same gang is responsible for
all the robberies,&#8221; put in Joe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks that way,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;It looks
as if there were a crook at the head of the bunch
who has pretty good brains.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A regular master criminal, Doughnuts?&#8221; gibed
Herb, then sobered again as he thought of his
father&#8217;s loss.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bad enough,&#8221; he said gloomily, &#8220;to hear of
other people&#8217;s property being stolen, but when it
comes right down to your own family, it&#8217;s getting
a little too close for comfort.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is your dad going to do about it?&#8221; asked
Bob.
</p>
<p>Herb shrugged his shoulders in a helpless gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can he do?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Except what
everybody else has done&mdash;inform the police and
hope the rascals will be caught. And even if they
are caught,&#8221; he added, still more gloomily, &#8220;it
won&#8217;t do dad much good, except that he&#8217;ll get revenge.
The crooks will probably have disposed of
all their stolen property before they&#8217;re caught.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Bob hopefully.
&#8220;Those fellows are getting a little bit too daring
for their own good. Some day they&#8217;ll go too far
and get caught.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so. But crooks like that are pretty
foxy,&#8221; returned Herb, refusing to be cheered.
&#8220;They&#8217;re apt to get away with murder before
they&#8217;re caught.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lads were silent for a moment, trying to
think things out, and when Bob spoke he unconsciously
put into words something of what his
comrades were thinking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems as if radio ought to be able to help
out in a case like this,&#8221; he said, with a puzzled
frown. &#8220;But I must say I don&#8217;t see how it can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t,&#8221; returned Herb. &#8220;If some one had
been lucky enough to get a glimpse of one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
thieves, then good old radio would have its chance.
We could wireless the description all over the
country and before long somebody would make
a capture.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bob nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where the cunning of these rascals
comes in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Either nobody sees them at
all, or when they do the thieves are so well disguised
by masks that a useful description isn&#8217;t
possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were the fellows who held up your father&#8217;s
truck masked?&#8221; asked Jimmy with interest.
</p>
<p>Herb nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From all I can hear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was a regular
highway robbery affair&mdash;masks, guns, and all
complete. The driver of the truck said there were
only two of them, but since they had guns and
he was unarmed, there wasn&#8217;t anything he could
do.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They made him get down off the truck, and
then they bound his hands behind him and hid
him behind some bushes that bordered the road.
He would probably be there yet if he hadn&#8217;t managed
to get the gag out of his mouth and hail some
people passing in an automobile. Poor fellow!&#8221;
he added. &#8220;Any one might have thought he had
robbed the truck from the way he looked. He
was afraid to face dad.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it wasn&#8217;t his fault,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;No man
without a weapon is a match for two armed rascals.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he say what the robbers looked like?&#8221;
insisted Jimmy. &#8220;He must have known whether
they were short or tall or fat or skinny.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He said they were about medium height, both
of them,&#8221; returned Herb. &#8220;He said they were
both about the same build&mdash;rather thin, if anything.
But their faces were so well covered&mdash;the
upper part by a mask and the lower by bandana
handkerchiefs&mdash;that he couldn&#8217;t give any
description of them at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I bet,&#8221; Bob spoke up suddenly, &#8220;that whoever
is at the head of that rascally gang knows the
danger of radio to him and his plans. That&#8217;s
why his men are so careful to escape recognition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys stared at him for a minute and then
suddenly the full force of what he intimated
struck them.
</p>
<p>At the same instant the name of the same man
came into their minds&mdash;the name of a man who
used radio for the exchange of criminal codes, a
man who stuttered painfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cassey!&#8221; they said together, and Herb added,
thoughtfully:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>OFF TO THE WOODS</h3>
</div>

<p>For days the town hummed with the excitement
that followed the daring robbery of the truck
belonging to Mr. Fennington, but as time passed
and there seemed little prospect of bringing the
robbers to justice, interest died down. But the
radio boys never abated their resolve to do all in
their power to recover the stolen merchandise,
although at that time they were kept so busy in
high school, preparing for a stiff examination,
that they had little time for anything else.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting so bad lately that I don&#8217;t even get
time to enjoy my meals,&#8221; grumbled Jimmy, one
sunny spring afternoon. &#8220;Swinging an oar a la
Ben Hur would be just a little restful exercise
after the way we&#8217;ve been drilling the last week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out!&#8221; exclaimed Joe. &#8220;Why, you
wouldn&#8217;t last two hours in one of those galleys,
Doughnuts. They&#8217;d heave you over the side as
excess baggage once they got wise to you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;After two hours of rowing in one of those old
galleys, he&#8217;d be glad to get heaved overboard, I&#8217;ll
bet,&#8221; put in Herb, grinning. &#8220;I think Jimmy
would rather drown any day than work that
hard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! I don&#8217;t see where you fellows get off
to criticize,&#8221; retorted the harassed youth. &#8220;I
never saw any of you win gold medals for hard
and earnest work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots of people deserve medals who never get
them,&#8221; Bob pointed out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But, likewise, lots of people don&#8217;t deserve
&#8217;em who don&#8217;t get &#8217;em,&#8221; retorted Jimmy,
and for once appeared to have won an argument.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right at that,&#8221; conceded Bob.
&#8220;But, anyway, I&#8217;m going to pass those examinations
no matter how hard I have to work. It
will pretty near break my heart, but it can&#8217;t be
helped.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others were equally determined, and they
dug into the mysteries of Horace and Euclid to
such good effect that they all passed the examinations
with flying colors. After that came a
breathing space, and just at that time a golden
opportunity presented itself.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fennington, Herbert&#8217;s father, had become
interested, together with several other business
men of Clintonia, in a timber deal comprising
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
many acres of almost virgin forest in the northern
part of the state. He was going to look over
the ground personally, and when Herb learned
of this, he urged his father to take him and the
other radio boys along for a brief outing over
the Easter holiday. When his father seemed extremely
dubious over this plan, Herb reminded
him that Mr. Layton had taken them all to Mountain
Pass the previous autumn, and that it would
be only fair to reciprocate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the Lookers are up in that part of the
country, too,&#8221; said Mr. Fennington. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you
fellows scared to go where Buck Looker is?&#8221; he
added, with a smile lurking about his mouth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, we&#8217;re terribly afraid of that!&#8221; answered
Herb sarcastically. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take our
chances, though, if you&#8217;ll only let us go with
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, I&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said his father, and Herb
knew that this was practically equivalent to surrender.
Accordingly he hunted up his chums and
broached the project to them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Herb, your words are as welcome as the flowers
in May,&#8221; Bob told him, with a hearty slap on
the back. &#8220;If this trip actually works out, we&#8217;ll
forgive you all last winter&#8217;s jokes, won&#8217;t we,
fellows?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an awful lot to ask of a fellow, but I
suppose we can manage it,&#8221; said Joe, and Jimmy,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
after pretending to think the matter over very
seriously, finally said the same.
</p>
<p>They were all overjoyed at the prospect of such
a trip, and had little difficulty in getting the consent
of their parents. Mr. Fennington eventually
consented to take the radio boys with him, and
there ensued several days of bustle and excited
packing. At length all was ready, and they
found themselves, one bright spring morning, installed
in a big seven-passenger touring car <i>en
route</i> for Braxton Woods, as the strip of timberland
was called.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the life!&#8221; chortled Jimmy, as the miles
rolled away behind. &#8220;Fresh air, bright sun, the
song of birds, and&mdash;doughnuts!&#8221; and he produced
a bulging paper bag full of his favorite dainty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you get that way?&#8221; asked Joe severely,
although he eyed the bag hungrily. &#8220;The
&#8216;song of doughnuts!&#8217; You&#8217;re the only Doughnut
that I ever heard of that could sing, and you&#8217;re
no great shakes at it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you know what I meant!&#8221; exclaimed
Jimmy. &#8220;At least, you&#8217;re thicker than usual if
you don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you hear that, Joe?&#8221; laughed Bob. &#8220;The
boy&#8217;s telling you that you&#8217;re thick. Are you going
to stand for that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows it&#8217;s true. And, anyway, he doesn&#8217;t
dare talk back for fear I won&#8217;t give him one of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
these delicious little morsels,&#8221; said Jimmy placidly.
&#8220;How about it, Joe?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s taking mean advantage of a poor fellow
who&#8217;s practically dying of starvation,&#8221; said Joe.
&#8220;Give me a doughnut, and I won&#8217;t talk back&mdash;until
after I&#8217;ve eaten it, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right then,&#8221; said his plump friend.
&#8220;After you&#8217;ve eaten one, you&#8217;ll feel so grateful
to me that you&#8217;ll regret all the low-down things
you&#8217;ve ever said about me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re the finest pal any fellow ever had,&#8221;
declared Joe. &#8220;How many doughnuts have you
left, Jimmy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something tells me that you don&#8217;t mean all you
say,&#8221; said Jimmy suspiciously. &#8220;Just the same,
I&#8217;ll take a chance and give you another one. They
won&#8217;t last long at the rate they&#8217;re going; I can
tell that without half trying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, a short life but a merry one,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;Come across with another, Jimmy, will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I love you too much to refuse you
anything, Bob,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;Just the same,
I&#8217;m going to hold out another for myself, and
then you big panhandlers can finish them up. I&#8217;ve
just had four, but I suppose those will have to last
me for the present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that&#8217;s tough&mdash;only four!&#8221; exclaimed
Herb, in mock sympathy. &#8220;What will you ever
do until lunch time, I wonder?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wondering the same thing myself; but I&#8217;m
used to suffering whenever I&#8217;m with you fellows,
so I suppose I&#8217;ll have to grin and bear it somehow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you didn&#8217;t bring some more,
while you were about it,&#8221; complained Bob. &#8220;You
might have known that wouldn&#8217;t be half enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a long time before I buy any more
for you Indians, you can bet your last dollar on
that,&#8221; said Jimmy, in an aggrieved voice.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been going to school a number of years,
now, but you still don&#8217;t know what &#8216;gratitude&#8217;
means.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only one that should be grateful is yourself,
Doughnuts,&#8221; Joe assured him. &#8220;You know
if you had eaten that whole bag full of doughnuts
that you&#8217;d have been heading a funeral to-morrow
or next day. It&#8217;s lucky you have us around to
save you from yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While Jimmy was still framing an indignant
reply to this there was a loud report, and the
driver quickly brought the big car to a halt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Blowout,&#8221; he remarked laconically, walking
around to view a shoe that was flat beyond the
possibility of doubt. It was not an unmixed evil
to the boys, however, for they welcomed the
chance to get out and stretch their cramped muscles.
They helped the driver jack up the wheel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
and change shoes, and in a short time they were
ready to proceed.
</p>
<p>Back they climbed into their places, and with a
rasp of changing gears they were on their way
once more.
</p>
<p>Braxton Woods lay something over a hundred
miles from Clintonia, but the roads were good
most of the way, and they had planned to reach
their destination that evening. When they had
covered sixty miles of the distance, Mr. Fennington
consented to stop for the lunch for which the
boys had been clamoring for some time. They
took their time over the meal, building a fire and
cooking steak and frying potatoes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, this was a feast fit for a king!&#8221; exclaimed
Jimmy, when it was over.
</p>
<p>The boys lay down on the newly sprouted grass,
but had hardly got settled when the driver, who
appeared restless, summoned them to proceed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a long way to go yet,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and the last fifteen miles are worse than all the
rest of the trip put together. The road is mostly
clay and rocks, and at this time of year it&#8217;s apt
to be pretty wet. I don&#8217;t want to have to drive it
after dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Fennington was also anxious to get on, so
their rest was a brief one, and they were soon on
their way again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>The radio boys laughed and sang, cracked jokes,
and waved to passing cars, while the mileage record
on the speedometer mounted steadily up. The
sun was still quite a way above the western horizon
when they reached the place where the forest
road branched off from the main highway. The
driver tackled this road cautiously, and they soon
found that his description of it had not been overdrawn.
It was a narrow trail, in most places not
wide enough for two cars to pass, and they wondered
what would happen should they meet another
car going in the opposite direction. But in
the whole fifteen miles they met only one other
motor, and fortunately that was at a wide place
in the road.
</p>
<p>The scent of spring and growing things was
strong in the air, and compensated somewhat for
the atrocious road. The boys were often tossed
high in the air as the car bumped over logs and
stones, or came up with a lurch out of some deep
hole. But they hung on to each other, or whatever
else was most convenient, and little minded
the rough going.
</p>
<p>After one particularly vicious lunge, however,
the heavy car came down with a slam, and there
was a sharp noise of snapping steel. With a muttered
exclamation the driver brought his car to
a halt and climbed out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as I thought!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;A spring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
busted, and the nearest garage twenty miles away.
Now we&#8217;re up against it for fair!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that we can&#8217;t go on?&#8221; asked Mr.
Fennington anxiously. &#8220;It will be dark in another
hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it will,&#8221; replied the chauffeur. &#8220;But
what can we do about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we make a temporary repair?&#8221; suggested
Bob. &#8220;We can&#8217;t have much further to go now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m open to suggestions, young fellow,&#8221;
growled the driver. &#8220;If you can tell me how to
fix this boiler up, go to it. It&#8217;s more than I can
do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bob and the others made a thorough examination
of the damage, and they were not long in
concocting a plan. Bob had brought with him a
small but very keen-edged ax, and it was the
work of only a few minutes to cut a stout limb
about six inches in diameter from a tree.
</p>
<p>With this, and a coil of heavy rope that was
carried in the car for emergencies, they proceeded
to make the temporary repair.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>PUT TO THE TEST</h3>
</div>

<p>First of all the boys trimmed the branch to a
length slightly greater than the distance between
axle and axle of the car. Then, near each end,
they cut a notch about two inches deep, one to fit
over the front and one over the rear axle. Next
they placed the branch in position, and with the
heavy rope lashed it securely into position. Thus
the front and rear axles were kept at the proper
distance from each other, and, moreover, the
side of the car that was over the broken spring
could rest on the stout pole.
</p>
<p>The driver, who at first had watched their efforts
with a derisive grin, took their plan more
seriously as he realized the scheme, and now he
examined the completed job with an air of surprised
respect.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to admit that that looks as though
it might do the trick,&#8221; he admitted, at length.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a lot of roadside repairs in my time,
but blest if that hasn&#8217;t got &#8217;em all beat. I&#8217;ll take
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
it at slow speed the rest of the way, and we&#8217;ll see
if it will stand up long enough to get us in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And get them in it did, in spite of much creaking
and groaning and bumping.
</p>
<p>The automobile drew up before a long one-story
building, constructed roughly but substantially
of unpainted boards. Supper was being
served, and they were just in time to partake of a
typical lumber camp meal. The big table was
laden with huge joints of meat, platters of biscuits
and vegetables, while strong, black coffee
was served in abundance. After this plates of
doughnuts were passed around, greatly to Jimmy&#8217;s
delight, and for once he could eat all he wanted
with nobody to criticize, for the lumbermen were
no tyros at this sort of thing, and packed away
food in quantities and at a speed that made the
boys gape.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, after they had emerged
into the balmy spring air outside, &#8220;I used to think
that Jimmy could eat; but he can&#8217;t even make the
qualifying heats with this crowd. You&#8217;re outclassed,
Doughnuts, beyond the chance of argument.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see but what I&#8217;ll have to admit it,&#8221;
sighed his rotund friend. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t care. It
seems like Heaven to be in a place where they
serve doughnuts like that. There&#8217;s none of this
&#8216;do-have-a-doughnut&#8217; business. Some big husky
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
passes you a platter with about a hundred on it
and says, &#8216;dig in, young feller.&#8217; Those are what
I call sweet sounding words.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you dug, all right,&#8221; remarked Joe, grinning.
&#8220;I saw you clean one platter off all by
your lonesome&mdash;at least, you came pretty near it,&#8221;
he qualified, with some last lingering regard for
the truth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t anything of the kind! But I only wish
I could,&#8221; lamented Jimmy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Doughnuts, nobody can deny
that you did your best,&#8221; laughed Herb. &#8220;After
you&#8217;ve had a little practice with this crowd, I&#8217;ll
back you against their champion eater any day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So would I,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;ve often talked
about entering Jimmy in a pie-eating contest, but
I never before thought we could find anybody who
would even stand a chance with him. Up here,
though, there&#8217;s some likely-looking material.
Judging from some of those huskies we saw to-night,
they might crowd our champion pretty
hard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can enter me any time you want to,&#8221; said
Jimmy. &#8220;Even if I didn&#8217;t win, I&#8217;d have a lot of
fun trying. I never really got enough pie at one
time yet, and that would be the chance of a lifetime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At first the boys were more than half joking,
but after they had been at the camp a few days
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
and had begun to get acquainted, they let drop
hints regarding Jimmy&#8217;s prowess that aroused
the interest of the lumbermen. He was covertly
watched at meal times, and as the bracing woodland
air and long hikes combined to give an added
edge to his appetite, his ability began to command
attention. There were several among the woodsmen
who had a reputation for large capacity, but
it was soon evident that Jimmy was not to be
easily outdistanced in his own particular department.
</p>
<p>At length interest became so keen that it was
decided to stage a real old-fashioned pie-eating
contest, to determine whether the champions of
the camp were to be outdistanced by a visitor from
the city. The cook was approached, and agreed
to make all the pies that, in all human probability,
would be needed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy, you&#8217;re in for it now!&#8221; exclaimed Herb,
dancing ecstatically about his plump friend.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s your chance to make good on all the
claims we&#8217;ve ever advanced for you. You&#8217;re up
against a strong field, but my confidence in you
is unshaken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It simply isn&#8217;t possible that our own Jimmy
could lose,&#8221; grinned Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen him wade
into pies before this, and I know what he can do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate your confidence, believe me,&#8221; said
Jimmy. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t care much whether I win
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
or not. I know I&#8217;ll get enough pie for once in my
life, and that&#8217;s the main thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The time for the contest was set for the following
evening, the third of their stay. Five lumbermen
had been put forward to uphold the reputation
of the camp, and they and Jimmy ate no supper
that night, waiting until the others had finished.
Then the board was cleared, and the cook
and his helper entered, bringing in several dozen
big pies of all varieties. One of these was placed
before each of the contestants, and they could
help themselves to as many more as their capacity
would admit.
</p>
<p>The cook, as having the best knowledge of matters
culinary, was appointed judge, and was provided
with a pad and pencil to check up each contestant.
A time limit of two hours was set, the
one having consumed the greatest amount of pie
in that time to be declared the winner.
</p>
<p>The cook gave the signal to start, and the contest
was on.
</p>
<p>The lumbermen started off at high speed, and
at first wrought tremendous havoc among the
pies, while Jimmy ate in his usual calm and placid
manner, evidently enjoying himself immensely.
Each of the lumbermen had his following, who
cheered him on and urged him to fresh endeavors.
Bob and Joe and Herb said little, for they had observed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
Jimmy&#8217;s prowess over a period of several
years, and knew his staying qualities.
</p>
<p>At the end of the first half hour their friend
was badly outdistanced, but the other contestants
had slowed up noticeably, while Jimmy still ate
calmly on, no faster and no slower than when he
had started. He was only starting on his second
pie when all the others were finishing theirs, but
the confidence of his three comrades remained
unshaken. They observed that the lumbermen
chose their third pies very carefully, and started
to eat them in a languid way. They were only
about half through when Jimmy disposed of his
second one, and started on a third.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel, Jimmy?&#8221; asked Herb, with
a grin. &#8220;Are you still hungry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not exactly hungry, but it still tastes
good,&#8221; replied Jimmy calmly. &#8220;You sure can
make good pies, Cook.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other contestants essayed feeble grins, but
it was easy to see that their pies no longer tasted
good to them. More and more slowly they ate,
while Jimmy kept placidly on, his original gait
hardly slackened. He finished the third pie and
started nonchalantly on a fourth. At sight of
this, and his confident bearing, two of the other
contestants threw up their hands and admitted
themselves beaten.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I used to like pie,&#8221; groaned one, &#8220;but now I
hope never to see one again. That youngster
must be made of rubber.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve often said the same thing myself,&#8221; chortled
Bob. &#8220;Just look at him! I believe he&#8217;s good
for a couple more yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Excitement ran high when two of the remaining
lumbermen were forced out toward the middle
of their fourth pie, leaving only Jimmy and a
jolly man of large girth, who before the start
had been picked by his companions as the undoubted
winner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to it, Jack!&#8221; the lumbermen shouted now.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let the youngster beat you out. He&#8217;s
pretty near his limit now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was true that flaky pie crust and luscious filling
had lost their charm for Jimmy, but his opponent
was in even worse plight. He managed to
finish his fourth pie, but when the cook handed
him a fifth, the task proved to be beyond him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve reached my limit, fellers,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;If the youngster can go pie number five, he&#8217;ll be
champion of the camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Excitement ran high as Jimmy slowly finished
the last crumbs of his fourth pie, and the cook
handed him a fifth. Would he take it, or would
the contest prove to be a draw?

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE BULLY GETS A DUCKING</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Our man doesn&#8217;t have to eat another whole
pie,&#8221; protested Bob. &#8220;If he just eats some of it
he&#8217;ll win, Mr. Judge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; nodded the cook. &#8220;How about
you, young feller? Are you able to tackle it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; responded Jimmy. &#8220;Hand it
over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He forced himself to cut and eat a small piece,
and when he had finished, pandemonium broke
loose. The judge declared him undisputed
champion of the camp, and he was caught up and
elevated to broad shoulders while an impromptu
triumphal procession was organized that circled
the camp with much laughter and many jokes at
the expense of the defeated aspirants for the
title.
</p>
<p>After this was over, the boys held a little private
jubilation of their own in the little cabin
where they were quartered with Mr. Fennington.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
He had been away during the contest, but he returned
shortly afterward, and laughingly congratulated
Jimmy on his newly won honors.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;Do you
think you could manage another piece of pie?
I&#8217;ll see that you have a large piece if you think
you can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir! I&#8217;ve had enough pie to last me for
a good while to come,&#8221; declared Jimmy positively.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be ashamed to look a pie in the face. For
the next week or so I&#8217;ll have to stick to my favorite
doughnuts for dessert.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you did nobly, Doughnuts, and I love
you more than ever,&#8221; declared Bob. &#8220;You were
up against a field that anybody might be proud
to beat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the best part of it, to me, is the feeling
that our confidence in Jimmy&#8217;s eating powers was
justified,&#8221; declared Joe. &#8220;After all the wonderful
exhibitions he&#8217;s given in the past, it would have
been terrible if he hadn&#8217;t come up to scratch to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The way that fellow they call Jack started off,
I never thought you had a chance, Jimmy,&#8221; confessed
Herb.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he could have held that pace, I wouldn&#8217;t
have had a look-in,&#8221; admitted Jimmy. &#8220;I figured
he&#8217;d have to slow down pretty soon, though.
&#8216;Slow but sure&#8217; is my motto.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How would you like to take a nice three-mile
sprint now?&#8221; asked Herb mischievously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three mile nothing!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmy scornfully.
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t run three yards right now. I
think I&#8217;ll lie down and give my digestion a
chance,&#8221; and in a few minutes he was peacefully
snoring.
</p>
<p>The next morning he showed no ill effects from
the prodigious feast, but ate his usual hearty breakfast.
The others were forced to the conclusion
that his table ability was even greater than they
had suspected, and from that time on they firmly
believed him to be invincible in his particular
department.
</p>
<p>By this time they were thoroughly familiar with
the camp, and decided to make an excursion into
the woods the following day, taking lunch with
them and making it a day&#8217;s outing. The cook
so far departed from his usual iron-clad rules as
to make them up a fine lunch, making due allowance
for Jimmy&#8217;s proven capacity.
</p>
<p>They started out immediately after breakfast.
Not being particular as to direction, they followed
the first old logging road that they came to. It
led them deeper and deeper into the forest that
was alive with the sounds and scents of spring.
Last year&#8217;s fallen leaves made a springy carpet
underfoot, while robins sang their spring song
in the budding branches overhead.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>For some time the boys tramped in silence,
breathing deeply of the exhilarating pine and balsam
atmosphere and at peace with all the world.
Soon there was a glint of water through the
trees, and the boys, with one accord, diverged
from the faint trail that they had been following
and were a few minutes later standing at the
water&#8217;s edge.
</p>
<p>They found themselves on the shore of a large
lake. It was ringed about with big trees, many of
which leaned far out over it as though to gaze at
their reflections in the water. The ripples lapped
gently on a sloping sandy beach, and the invitation
to swim proved irresistible to all but Jimmy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what lake water is like at this time of
year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You fellows can go in and freeze
yourselves all you like, but I&#8217;ll stay right here and
look after the things. Just dive right in and
enjoy yourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we won&#8217;t coax you,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;But
that water looks too good to miss. It is pretty
cold, but I guess that won&#8217;t kill us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Off came their clothes, and with shouts and
laughter they splashed through the shallow water
and struck out manfully. The icy water made
them gasp at first, but soon the reaction came, and
they thoroughly enjoyed their swim. They tried
to coax Jimmy in, but he lay flat on his back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
under a tree and was adamant to all their pleadings.
</p>
<p>The others did not stay in very long, but
emerged glowing from the effects of exercise and
the cold water. As they were getting into their
clothes they heard voices coming toward them,
and they had hardly finished dressing when the
voices&#8217; owners came crashing through the underbrush
close to where the boys were standing.
</p>
<p>The two groups stared in astonishment for a
few moments, for the newcomers were none other
than Carl Lutz, Buck Looker, Terry Mooney,
and another older fellow, who was a stranger to
the radio boys.
</p>
<p>Buck&#8217;s expression of surprise quickly gave place
to an ugly sneer, and he turned to his friends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look who&#8217;s here!&#8221; he cried, in a nasty tone.
&#8220;I wonder what they&#8217;re up to now, Carl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not hiding from the cops because we
broke a plate glass window and were afraid to
own up to it,&#8221; Bob told him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who broke a window?&#8221; demanded Buck.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t prove that it wasn&#8217;t a snowball that
one of your own bunch threw that broke that
window.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t throw that kind of snowballs,&#8221; said
Joe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; asked Buck.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are you trying to say that we put stones in our
snowballs?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to say it,&#8221; retorted Joe. &#8220;You
just said it yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Too late Buck realized his mistake, and his
coarse red face grew purple as Herb and Jimmy
grinned at him in maddening fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you laugh at me, Jimmy Plummer!&#8221; he
exclaimed, picking on Jimmy as being the least
warlike of the radio boys. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make you laugh
out of the other side of your mouth in a minute,&#8221;
and he started to dash past Bob to reach his
victim.
</p>
<p>But to do so he had to pass between Bob and
the bank of the lake, which just at this point was
a foot or so above the water.
</p>
<p>As he rushed past, Bob adroitly shot out a
muscular arm and his elbow caught the bully fair
in the side. Buck staggered, made a wild effort
to regain his balance, and with a prodigious
splash disappeared in the icy waters of the
lake.
</p>
<p>For a few seconds friend and enemy gazed
anxiously at the spot where he had gone under,
but he soon came to the surface, and, sputtering
and fuming, struck out for the shore and dragged
himself out on to dry land.
</p>
<p>He made such a ludicrous figure that even his
cronies could not forbear laughing, but he turned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
on them furiously and their laughter suddenly
ceased. Then he turned to Bob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t have these wet clothes on, I&#8217;d
make you pay for that right now, Bob Layton,&#8221; he
sputtered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make you sorry for that before
you&#8217;re much older.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not settle it right now?&#8221; offered Bob.
&#8220;Your clothes will dry soon enough, don&#8217;t worry
about that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know you&#8217;d like nothing better than to
see me get pneumonia,&#8221; said Buck. &#8220;You wait
here till I go home and get dry clothes on, and
I&#8217;ll come and give you the licking that you deserve.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s only a bluff, and you know it,&#8221; said
Bob contemptuously. &#8220;But if any of your friends
would like to take your place, why, here I am.
How about you, Lutz?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Carl muttered something unintelligible, and
backed away. The others likewise seemed discouraged
by the mischance to their leader, for
they turned and followed his retreating form
without another word.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some sports!&#8221; commented Joe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Game as a mouse,&#8221; supplemented Herb.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a swell ducking you gave Buck,&#8221;
chuckled Jimmy. &#8220;Just when he was going to
pick on me, too. I owe you something for that,
Bob.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pay me when you get rich and famous,&#8221;
laughed his friend. &#8220;You don&#8217;t owe me anything,
anyway. It was a pleasure to shove Buck into
the lake. I&#8217;m perfectly willing to do it again any
time I get the chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s my turn next time,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t let you hog all the fun, Bob.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied his friend. &#8220;If we run
into him again, I&#8217;ll leave him to your tender mercies.
But I don&#8217;t imagine he or his friends will
bother us any more to-day, so why not have
lunch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking the same thing,&#8221; remarked
Jimmy, and they forthwith set to work to prepare
what Jimmy termed a &#8220;bang-up lunch.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>A STARTLING DISCOVERY</h3>
</div>

<p>The cook had supplied the radio boys with a
lavish hand, but their long walk and the swim
had given them ravenous appetites, and by the
time they finished there was little left of the
lunch. Even this little was soon disposed of by
the bright-eyed birds that ventured close in pursuit
of the tempting bits. By sitting as still as
statues the boys succeeded in enticing the little
fellows almost within arm&#8217;s length, and derived no
little amusement at the evident struggle between
greed and caution.
</p>
<p>But soon the last crumb was gone, and after
a short rest the lads began to think of returning
to camp. They did not want to go back by the
same road over which they had come, however,
so decided to follow the shores of the lake until
they should find some other path. This was, of
course, a roundabout way of getting home, but
they had the better part of the afternoon before
them, and were in no particular hurry.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come on over to the north,&#8221; suggested Joe.
&#8220;I think there is another trail in that direction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I imagine the walking is better,&#8221; put
in Herb.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you don&#8217;t want to go too far out of the
way,&#8221; came hastily from Jimmy. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to
walk back remember.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forward it is!&#8221; cried Bob. &#8220;Come on, Jimmy,
you&#8217;ve got to walk off that big lunch you stowed
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, if I walk too far I&#8217;ll be hungry again
before I get home,&#8221; sighed the stout youth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow! hear Jimmy complain,&#8221; burst out Joe.
&#8220;He hardly has one meal down than he&#8217;s thinking
of another.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To find another trail was not as simple a matter
as it had seemed, and they must have traveled
over two miles before Bob&#8217;s keen eyes detected a
slight break in the dry underbrush that might
denote a path such as they sought. They found a
dim trail leading in the general direction in which
they wished to go, and set out at a brisk pace,
even Jimmy being willing to hurry as visions of
the loaded supper table floated before him.
</p>
<p>Gradually the path widened out, as others ran
into it, until it became a fairly well-defined woods
road. It was thickly strewn with last year&#8217;s soft
and rotting leaves, and the boys made little sound
in spite of the rapidity of their pace. Bob and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
Joe and Herb were striding along in a group,
Jimmy having dropped behind while he fixed
a refractory shoe lace, when suddenly Bob halted
abruptly and held up a warning hand. The
others, scenting something amiss, stopped likewise,
looking inquiringly at Bob.
</p>
<p>Silently he pointed to a spot slightly ahead of
them and several paces off the road. Even as
the others gazed wonderingly, Bob beckoned them
to follow and slipped silently into the brush that
lined the road.
</p>
<p>On the other side stood a big tree, its trunk and
branches sharply outlined against the clear sky.
At the base of this tree, with his back toward
them, stood a man. Now, the surprising part of
it all, and that which had caused the boys to proceed
so cautiously, was the fact that the man
wore headphones and was evidently receiving a
message of some kind. Fastened to the tree was
a box, which evidently contained telephonic apparatus.
At first the boys thought he must be
listening at an ordinary telephone, but the fact
that he had no transmitter indicated that he was
listening in on a radio receiving set.
</p>
<p>The boys had hardly reached their place of concealment
when the man turned sharply about,
darting furtive glances here and there, evidently
in search of possible intruders. The boys
crouched lower behind the bushes and prayed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
fervently that Jimmy would not arrive before the
man had gone. The fellow was of fair size, with
a deeply tanned face, and wore a moustache.
Fortunately, after they had been watching him a
few minutes, he removed the earphones, placed
them in the box, and, after locking it, started into
the woods, following a dimly marked footpath.
</p>
<p>It was well that he left when he did, for not two
minutes later Jimmy came puffing along, looking
anxiously for the others. He stopped in amazement
when he saw his friends emerge from the
bushes, and was about to raise his voice in vehement
questionings when Bob leaped at him and
clapped a hand over his mouth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quiet!&#8221; he hissed into his ear. &#8220;There&#8217;s
some funny work going on here, and we want to
find out what it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thus admonished, Jimmy was released, and in
low tones the others told him of what they had
seen and showed him the box fastened to the tree.
While they were about it, they made a hasty
search for the antenna, and found it strung close
to the trunk of the tree, extending from the top
almost to the roots. After this discovery they
hurried after the man with the moustache, fearful
lest they should lose his trail.
</p>
<p>It was no easy matter to follow the dimly
marked path, for it passed at times over stony
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
ground and big boulders, where often it took much
searching here and there before they picked up its
continuation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We may be taking all this trouble for nothing,&#8221;
said Bob, after one of these searches.
&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s just a lumberman receiving instruction
by wireless from his employers. Big business
firms are using radio more and more for
such purposes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t like the way he kept looking about
him, as though he had something to conceal,&#8221; objected
Joe. &#8220;It can&#8217;t do any harm to see where
he goes, anyway. We may find out something
important.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His hands weren&#8217;t those of a lumberman,&#8221; observed
Herb. &#8220;Those hands never saw rough
work nor, judging from the man&#8217;s face and manner,
honest work. Come on, fellows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Accordingly the boys followed the difficult trail
with untiring patience, and at last their perseverance
was rewarded. The path widened out into a
little clearing, and at the further side of this was
a rough log cabin. The little shack had two small
windows, and with infinite caution the boys approached
until they could see into the nearest one.
</p>
<p>The interior was rudely furnished with a heavy
table and two crudely fashioned chairs, while in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
the corner furthest from them two bunks had
been built, one above the other. In another corner
was a compact radio transmitting set.
</p>
<p>At the table was seated the man with the
moustache, intently studying a notebook propped
up before him. From this he made notes on a
sheet of paper, scowling at times like one engaged
in a difficult task. At length he shoved back his
chair, rose to his feet, and, striding across the
little shack, carefully placed the notebook under a
board on a shelf. Luckily he was so absorbed in
what he was doing that he did not even glance
toward the window where the radio boys were
observing his every motion.
</p>
<p>But Bob now judged that they had seen enough,
and he wished to run no unnecessary risk of detection.
At a signal from him they made for the
underbrush at the edge of the clearing, where they
could command a view of the door, and waited to
see if the mysterious stranger would emerge.
</p>
<p>In a few minutes the door opened and the man
stepped out, stopping to fasten it securely behind
him. Then, with a quick glance about the little
clearing, he made for the path leading to the main
road and in a short time the sound of his going
died away.
</p>
<p>The boys waited a few minutes, thinking that
possibly he might return for something forgotten,
but no further sound came from the path. At
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
length they ventured to approach the deserted
cabin.
</p>
<p>The door had been fastened with a heavy padlock,
but this was not sufficient to deter the radio
boys. Searching through their pockets for some
implement with which they could undo the lock,
Jimmy discovered a stout fish-hook, and after
they had ground off the barbs against a flat stone
this made an ideal tool. With it Bob probed about
in the interior of the padlock, and at length, with
a sharp click, it sprung open. Ordinarily he
would not have done this, but he had every reason
to believe that he was dealing with a criminal and
that he was justified in the interest of law and
order in taking steps that would prevent any
further depredations against society.
</p>
<p>&#8220;More ways than one of killing a cat,&#8221; remarked
Bob, as he pushed open the heavy door
and entered the cabin. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to know
what&#8217;s in that notebook before we leave this place.
Let&#8217;s have a look.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys quickly brought the book from its place
of concealment and carried it to the table, where
they bent eagerly over it as Bob turned the pages.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look like sense to me,&#8221; complained
Jimmy. &#8220;I never saw such a lot of fool words
jumbled together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but something tells me there&#8217;s method in
this madness,&#8221; said Bob, his brows knit as he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
concentrated on the problem before him. &#8220;Say,
fellows!&#8221; he exclaimed, as sudden excitement
gripped him, &#8220;do you remember those nights we
were listening to our big set and we heard the
mysterious messages? They were just a lot of
words, and we couldn&#8217;t make anything out of
them at the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I remember!&#8221; exclaimed Joe. &#8220;I
think I could even tell you most of the words.
Why, there&#8217;s some of them in that book, right
now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; replied Bob, nodding. &#8220;I remember
them, too, and this must be the key to the code.
My stars, what luck! Let&#8217;s see how close we can
recall the words we caught, and then we&#8217;ll see if
we can make sense of them with the help of this
key.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you the words as I remember them,
and you check me up,&#8221; suggested Joe, and this
they accordingly did.
</p>
<p>Between them they managed to get it straight,
just as they had heard it, &#8220;Corn-hay-six-paint-water-slow-sick-jelly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Anyway,
we&#8217;ll see if it comes right with the key. You read
the words, Joe, and I&#8217;ll find them in this notebook
and you can write them down. Shoot the
first one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Corn,&#8221; said Joe.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>Bob hunted rapidly down the columns of code
words and their equivalents, and soon found the
one he was after.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Motor truck,&#8221; he read out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds promising!&#8221; exclaimed Joe.
&#8220;The next word I&#8217;ve got is &#8216;hay.&#8217; What&#8217;s the
answer to that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Silk,&#8221; said Bob, after a shorter search this
time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Six,&#8221; read Joe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Castleton Road!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, his voice
shaking with excitement as he traced down the
columns of words. Herb and Jimmy were also
excited; especially the former, as he realized better
than the others how serious a loss the theft
of his father&#8217;s truckload of silk had been and
now thought he saw some clue in this message that
might throw light on the whereabouts of the
stolen goods.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE ROBBERS&#8217; CODE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The next word is &#8216;paint,&#8217;&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;What
does that stand for, Bob?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a minute, till I find it,&#8221; replied his friend,
and after turning over several pages found the
word he sought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It means &#8216;to-night,&#8217;&#8221; he said. &#8220;Read what we&#8217;ve
got so far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Motor truck&mdash;silk&mdash;Castleton Road&mdash;to-night,&#8221;
read Joe. &#8220;That&#8217;s clear enough so far.
The next code word is water.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No guards,&#8217;&#8221; said Bob. And so they went,
until the completed message read as follows:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Motor truck&mdash;silk&mdash;Castleton Road&mdash;to-night&mdash;no
guards&mdash;hold up&mdash;take everything to
usual place&mdash;notify when job is done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the message that caused the theft of
my father&#8217;s merchandise!&#8221; exclaimed Herb, jumping
to his feet. &#8220;If we had only had the key then,
when there was still time, we could have prevented
the hold-up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely we could,&#8221; agreed Bob soberly.
&#8220;But we may be able to do the next best thing,
Herb&mdash;get the stuff back again. If we make a
copy of this key and then leave the book just
where we found it, the thieves will never dream
that anybody knows their secret, and they&#8217;ll keep
right on using the same code.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Herb slowly. &#8220;And then if we
hear any more code messages we can translate
them with this key, and likely get on the trail of
the crooks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; replied Bob. &#8220;Now, I have a notebook
here, and if one of you fellows will dictate
that code, I&#8217;ll copy it down and we&#8217;ll get out of
here while the getting&#8217;s good. There&#8217;s no telling
what minute some of the gang will show up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll dictate,&#8221; volunteered Joe. &#8220;But while you
and I are doing that, Bob, why can&#8217;t Jimmy and
Herb act as lookouts? Then if any of the gang
comes along they can give us warning and we&#8217;ll
clear out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good advice,&#8221; agreed Bob, and Herb
and Jimmy went outside and up the path a short
distance, where they crouched, listening, with
every muscle tense to warn their comrades if
danger threatened.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the cabin, Bob&#8217;s pencil flew at
furious speed as Joe dictated. The code was very
complete, and consisted of over two hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
words, each word, in some cases, standing for a
whole phrase. Bob wrote as he had never written
before, but in spite of his utmost efforts it took
over an hour to copy the entire list. He and Joe
expected every minute to hear Herb or Jimmy
give the alarm, but the woods remained calm and
peaceful, and they finished their task without
interruption.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the last word, Bob!&#8221; exclaimed Joe,
with a sigh of relief. &#8220;Let&#8217;s put that little book
back on the shelf where we found it, and make a
quick getaway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ve got to make tracks,&#8221; agreed Bob.
&#8220;It will be away after dark now when we get
back to the camp. If we don&#8217;t hurry they will be
organizing searching parties for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With great care he placed the notebook back
on the shelf, under the board, and then gazed
searchingly around the cabin to make sure that
no signs of their visit were left behind to warn
the thieves. After assuring himself that everything
was exactly as they had found it, he and Joe
left the rude habitation, snapping the big padlock
through the hasp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a swell lock,&#8221; observed Joe, grinning.
&#8220;It looks strong enough to discourage anybody,
but Jimmy&#8217;s fish-hook licked it to a frazzle in no
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way with a lot of padlocks,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
Bob, as the two started off in search of the others.
&#8220;It would take dynamite to break them open, but
they&#8217;re easy enough to pick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you know how, that is,&#8221; supplemented Joe,
with a grin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s understood,&#8221; replied Bob. &#8220;It&#8217;s
hard to do anything without the know-how.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They soon picked up the two sentinels, who
were greatly relieved to see them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were going to spend the night
there,&#8221; grumbled Jimmy. &#8220;What happened?
Did you both fall asleep in the middle of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an ungrateful rascal, Doughnuts,&#8221; answered
Joe. &#8220;Here Bob and I have worked like
slaves for the last hour, while all you had to do
was loaf around in the nice fresh air. Then instead
of thanking us, you growl because we took
so long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t get sore,&#8221; protested Jimmy. &#8220;I
suppose we should all be so happy over this discovery
that we shouldn&#8217;t mind anything. I&#8217;ll bet
your father will be tickled to death, Herb.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he will,&#8221; agreed Herb. &#8220;Although
we&#8217;re still a long way from getting back the stolen
silk. There&#8217;s no doubt that we&#8217;ve struck a mighty
promising clue, that much is sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bob was about to make some remark when he
checked himself and halted in a listening attitude.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think some one is coming!&#8221; he exclaimed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
in a low tone. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I heard voices. Let&#8217;s
duck into the underbrush, quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were not a moment too soon, for they had
hardly reached a place of concealment behind a
great fallen tree when two men appeared around a
bend in the path. One was the same whom they
had followed a few hours before, while the other
was a stranger to them. This man was of a desperate
and unprepossessing appearance, and a
bulge under his coat suggested the possible presence
of a weapon.
</p>
<p>The boys congratulated themselves that this
formidable looking personage had not arrived
half an hour sooner, for they were of course unarmed
and would have been hard put to it had
they been caught in the cabin.
</p>
<p>They lay snugly hidden in their retreat behind
the fallen tree until the voices of the two men
had died away in the direction of the lonely cabin.
Then they returned cautiously to the path and
hastened toward the main road. This they
reached without meeting any one else, and set
out for camp at a pace that caused Jimmy to cry
for mercy. But the shadows lay long athwart
the path, camp was still an indefinite distance
away, and they hurried the unfortunate youth
along at a great rate in spite of his piteous protests.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be the best thing in the world for you,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
Doughnuts,&#8221; said Joe unfeelingly. &#8220;What you
need is plenty of exercise to take that fat off
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides, think of what a fine appetite you&#8217;ll
have when we reach camp,&#8221; laughed Bob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got all the appetite now that I know
how to have,&#8221; groaned Jimmy. &#8220;You fellows
haven&#8217;t a heart between you. Where other people
keep their hearts, you&#8217;ve all got chunks of Vermont
granite.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Flash a little speed, and don&#8217;t talk so much,&#8221;
advised Herb. &#8220;Be like the tramp that the fellow
met going down the street one day with an expensive
rug.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who wants to be like a tramp?&#8221; objected
Jimmy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do, when you want to loaf all the time,&#8221;
retorted Herb. &#8220;But now I&#8217;ll tell you a good
joke to make the way seem shorter. Jimmy got
me started, and now I&#8217;ll have to get it out of my
system.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it about a tramp?&#8221; asked Jimmy suspiciously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And it&#8217;s a pippin,&#8221; Herb assured him.
&#8220;It seems this tramp was running down the street
with an expensive rug over his shoulder, and
somebody stopped him and began to ask questions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where did you steal that rug from?&#8217; asked
the suspicious citizen.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I didn&#8217;t steal it,&#8217; answered the tramp, trying
to look insulted. &#8216;A lady in that big house down
the street handed it to me and told me to beat it,
and I am.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that&#8217;s a pretty good joke, for you, Herb,&#8221;
said Bob, laughing with the others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s nothing. I&#8217;ve got others just as
good,&#8221; said Herb eagerly. &#8220;Now, here&#8217;s one
that I made up myself the other day, but I forgot
to tell it to you. Why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suffering tomcats!&#8221; exclaimed Joe. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
tell us anything that you made up yourself, Herb!
Or, at least, wait until we get back and have supper,
so that we&#8217;ll be strong enough to stand it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say,&#8221; agreed Jimmy. &#8220;I&#8217;m so
hungry that I can&#8217;t think of anything but supper,
anyway. I know your joke is as good as usual,
Herb, but I wouldn&#8217;t be able to appreciate it just
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s discouraging to a high-class humorist to
have to throw away his choice offerings on a
bunch like this,&#8221; said Herb, in an injured voice.
&#8220;Some day, when I am far away, you&#8217;ll wish you
had listened to those gems of humor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to believe you, but that hardly seems
possible,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Can you imagine the day
ever coming when we&#8217;d actually want to sit down
and listen to Herb&#8217;s line of humor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My imagination isn&#8217;t up to anything like that,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
replied Joe. &#8220;But, of course, you don&#8217;t really
ever have to ask Herb to spill some of those jokes.
The hard thing is to keep him from doing it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, all right,&#8221; retorted Herb. &#8220;Only, remember
that it is &#8216;easier to criticize than to create.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>For some time after this they plodded along
hoping to reach camp before it got entirely dark.
Bob was the first to see a distant point of light
through the trees, and he emitted a whoop that
startled the others.

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>ON THE TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I can see the lights from the camp!&#8221; Bob
exclaimed. &#8220;Use your eyes, fellows. A little to
the left of us, through the trees.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s about time,&#8221; groaned Jimmy, as
they all looked in the direction indicated. &#8220;I was
just getting ready to lie down and die peacefully.
I couldn&#8217;t travel another mile if you paid me for
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, buck up, Doughnuts, and get a move
on!&#8221; exclaimed Bob. &#8220;You never know what
you can do until you try. Come on, let&#8217;s take it
on the double.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He and Joe and Herbert broke into a lively
trot, and rather than be left behind Jimmy overcame
his reluctance for further effort, and with
much puffing and blowing and fragmentary complaint
managed to hold the pace until they arrived
at the mess house.
</p>
<p>Luckily for them, supper had been delayed
owing to the failure of some supplies to arrive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
on time, and the lumbermen had just started eating
when the radio boys burst in through the
door.
</p>
<p>The lumbermen stopped eating long enough to
welcome their arrival, and they found their places
set as usual.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory be!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmy, as he slid into
his chair. &#8220;If there were a pie-eating contest on
to-night, I could show you fellows some real class.
I feel empty right down to my toes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky we got a head start, Champ,&#8221; remarked
one of the men, with a grin. &#8220;Pass everything
down this way, you amateurs. There&#8217;s a
professional here wants to show us some fancy
eating.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time Jimmy was too busily occupied to
make any answer, and the other radio boys were
also showing good appetites. The long trip and
the excitement of their discovery of the secret
code had sharpened their naturally keen appetites
until for once they all felt on equal terms with the
lumbermen. Jimmy surpassed himself, and great
was the admiration expressed for his ability as a
trencherman.
</p>
<p>After supper the boys sought out Mr. Fennington
and told him of their discovery in the
lonely cabin. Then Bob showed him the copy
he had made of the code, and Mr. Fennington
studied this a long time with knit brows.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There seems little doubt that you boys have
unearthed an important clue, and one that may
easily lead to the discovery of the crooks who
stole my merchandise,&#8221; he said, at length. &#8220;I
suppose I should put this information in the hands
of the police. And yet perhaps we had better
say nothing until we learn something further.
With your radio outfit you may be able to catch
another code message that would give us more
definite information, and then it would be time
enough to call in the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that would be the best thing to do,
Dad,&#8221; agreed Herb. &#8220;As soon as we get back
home we&#8217;ll fix it so one of us will be at the set a
good part of every afternoon and evening, and
we&#8217;ll be almost certain to catch some more messages
like the last one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His father nodded, and was still considering
the matter when there came a knock at the door.
Herb crossed over and opened it, and he and his
friends uttered exclamations of astonishment and
delight as they recognized the visitor. He was
none other than Frank Brandon, the government
radio inspector.
</p>
<p>On his part, he was no less pleased to see them,
and they all shook hands heartily, with many questions
and explanations, after which the radio inspector
was introduced to Mr. Fennington.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re all wondering what I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
doing up here,&#8221; he said, after the greetings were
over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, in a way,&#8221; admitted Bob. &#8220;Although we
know that your position calls you all over, and
we may expect to meet you almost any old place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; replied Brandon. &#8220;I&#8217;m
up here on the same old business, too. Somewhere
in this neighborhood there&#8217;s an unauthorized
sending station, but in these thick woods it
may prove a rather difficult place to locate exactly.
However, it will only be a matter of time
when we nail it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys glanced at one another, and the same
thought was in all their minds. They remembered
the radio apparatus they had seen in the
lonely cabin, and had little doubt that this would
prove to be the unauthorized station of which the
radio man was in search.
</p>
<p>He must have read something of this in their
expression, for he looked searchingly from one
to another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me as though you fellows knew
something,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I might have known
if there was anything going on in the radio line
within fifty miles of where you are that you&#8217;d
know something about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got a hunch that we could lead
you right to the place you&#8217;re looking for,&#8221; said
Bob quietly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; shouted Brandon, leaping excitedly
to his feet. &#8220;Do you really mean that? Tell
me all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For the second time that evening Bob recounted
the happenings of their eventful excursion, while
the radio inspector listened intently, throwing in
a question here and there. When Bob had finished
he made no comment for a few minutes.
</p>
<p>Then he took the copy of the code and examined
it intently, jotting down phrases here and
there in his own notebook.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said at length, &#8220;this looks to be a
much bigger thing than I had supposed. Of
course I heard of the robbery of the motor-truck,
but I never for a moment connected that with this
sending station we&#8217;ve been looking for. It seems
fairly evident, though, that if we can lay our
hands on the operators of the unauthorized sending
outfit, we&#8217;ll also have the perpetrators of that
hold-up. This is a case where we&#8217;ll have to think
out every move before we act.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just before you arrived I was considering the
advisability of putting the matter into the hands
of the police,&#8221; said Mr. Fennington. &#8220;What
would you do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep the whole thing to ourselves for the
present,&#8221; said Mr. Brandon decisively. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
send for a couple of good men to come up here
and help me, and we&#8217;ll keep a watch on that cabin
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
for a few days. If this thing got into the papers,
it would put the crooks on their guard, and probably
spoil our chances of catching them and getting
back the loot. I&#8217;ve got a small but extremely
efficient receiving and sending set in my car, and
if any more code messages are sent out we&#8217;ll catch
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His confidence was contagious, and the boys
felt almost as though the capture of the criminals
had already been accomplished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What puzzles me, though,&#8221; remarked Mr.
Fennington, &#8220;is how you knew that there was an
unauthorized radio sending station in this
neighborhood, Mr. Brandon. I should think it
would be almost impossible to locate such a station,
even approximately.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; replied Frank Brandon, &#8220;it
is little more than a matter of routine. Probably
any of these radio fiends here could explain the
method as well as I can, but I&#8217;ll try to make it
plain to you.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a certain type of aerial that has what
we call &#8216;directional&#8217; properties, that is, when it is
shifted around, the incoming signals will be
loudest when this loop aerial, as it is called, is
directly in line with the sending station. The receiving
antenna is wound on a square frame, and
when the signals are received at their maximum
strength, we know that the frame is in a practically
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
straight line with the sending station we&#8217;re
after.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but that still leaves you in the dark as
to whether the station is one mile away or a hundred
miles,&#8221; observed Mr. Fennington, as Brandon
paused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very true,&#8221; answered the other. &#8220;And
for that reason we can&#8217;t stop at using just one
loop aerial. What we actually do is to have
three stations, each one equipped with a loop.
These three stations are located a good many
miles apart. Now, with these three loops, we
have three lines of direction. We lay out these
lines on a chart of the territory, and where they
intersect, is the place where the unlicensed station
is located. Is that clear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly,&#8221; said Mr. Fennington. &#8220;But what
looks like a point on the map may be a large space
on the actual territory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, our work isn&#8217;t done by any means
after we have got our first rough bearings,&#8221; continued
Brandon. &#8220;Having determined the approximate
position, we take the loops and receivers
to what we know is a place quite near the
station we&#8217;re after, and then we repeat the former
process. This time it is much more accurate.
Gradually we draw the net tighter until we find
the antenna belonging to the offender, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
then&mdash;well, we make him wish he hadn&#8217;t tried to fool the
government.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly have it reduced to an exact
science,&#8221; acknowledged Mr. Fennington. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
wonder that everybody interested in radio gets
to be a fanatic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make a &#8216;bug&#8217; out of you before we get
through, Dad,&#8221; declared Herb, grinning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If my load of silk is recovered through the
agency of radio, I&#8217;ll be enthusiastic enough over
it to suit even you fellows,&#8221; said his father. &#8220;It
will mean the best set that money can buy for
you if I get it back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hold you to that promise,&#8221; threatened
Herb. &#8220;Radio can do anything,&#8221; he added, with
the conviction of a devotee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, pretty nearly everything,&#8221; qualified Mr.
Brandon. &#8220;A little while ago it was considered
marvelous that we could transmit the voice by
radio, and now the transmission of photographs
by radio has been successfully accomplished.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Fennington incredulously.
&#8220;Do you mean to say that an actual recognizable
photograph has been sent through the
air by radio? That seems almost too much to
believe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, it has been done,&#8221; insisted Frank
Brandon. &#8220;I saw the actual reproduction of one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
that had been sent from Italy to New York by
the wireless route, and while I can&#8217;t claim that it
was perfect, still it was as plain as the average
newspaper picture. And don&#8217;t forget that this is
a new phase of the game, and is not past the experimental
stage yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, after that, I am inclined to agree with
Herbert that &#8216;radio can do anything,&#8217;&#8221; admitted
Mr. Fennington.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll have much trouble making
a convert of you,&#8221; laughed the radio inspector.
&#8220;No doubt the quickest way, though, will be to
recover your stolen shipment, so we&#8217;ll start working
in that direction the first thing in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And in this he was as good as his word. He
was up betimes, getting in touch with headquarters
by means of his compact portable outfit. He
kept at work until he had received the promise of
two trustworthy men, who were to report to him
at the lumber camp as soon as they could get
there. Then he routed out the radio boys, and
after a hasty breakfast they all set out to locate
the cabin where the boys had found the code key.

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE GLIMPSE THROUGH THE WINDOW</h3>
</div>

<p>The sun was just climbing above the treetops
when the radio boys and Frank Brandon
set out over the forest road, to the accompaniment
of a full chorus of lusty feathered singers. Robin
and starling and thrush combined to make the
dewy morning gladsome, and the boys whistled
back at them and wished Larry Bartlett were
there to learn some new notes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This would be just his dish,&#8221; commented
Herb. &#8220;After he got warmed up, you wouldn&#8217;t
be able to tell him from the birds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only difference is, that he&#8217;s better,&#8221; declared
Joe. &#8220;If he were here now, he&#8217;d be teaching
the dicky birds a new song or two. That boy
is certainly a wonder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very clever,&#8221; acknowledged Brandon.
&#8220;He&#8217;s getting along wonderfully well at the broadcasting
station, and I understand he&#8217;s had several
good offers from the big vaudeville circuits.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t he accept one?&#8221; questioned Joe.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t fully recovered from the effects of
the accident yet. And, besides, he says he likes
the radio work better. He can stay in one place,
and cut out all the traveling. That seems to be a
strong consideration with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I can blame him,&#8221; commented
Bob. &#8220;I should think that continual
jumping around from place to place would get
on anybody&#8217;s nerves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, it gives one a fine chance to see the
country,&#8221; argued Frank Brandon. &#8220;If any of you
fellows ever get into radio work in a commercial
way, the chances are you won&#8217;t be able to &#8216;stay put&#8217;
in one place very long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one great advantage about traveling,
anyway,&#8221; said Jimmy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, Doughnuts?&#8221; queried Joe. &#8220;I
should think that with your restful nature you&#8217;d
rather stay in the same place and grow old and
fat in perfect comfort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that part of it is all right,&#8221; admitted
Jimmy. &#8220;But don&#8217;t forget that different parts
of the country have different kinds of cooking.
In New York the specialty is shore dinners; go
a little South, and you get fried chicken and corn
pone cooked by guaranteed southern mammies;
go up North, and you get venison steaks; in the
West they&#8217;ll feed you mutton chops as big as a
plate. And so it goes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve even forgotten some places,&#8221; laughed
Bob. &#8220;How about a steaming dish of beans in
Boston?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, or frijoles and chile con carne in New
Mexico,&#8221; suggested Herb.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cease, cease!&#8221; groaned Jimmy. &#8220;Why talk
about such things when we&#8217;re such a long way
from them? Every time you mention something
new it makes me feel hungrier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hungrier!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Brandon. &#8220;Why,
it&#8217;s hardly half an hour since we finished breakfast!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What has breakfast got to do with it?&#8221; demanded
the insatiable Jimmy. &#8220;That&#8217;s past and
done with. It&#8217;s time to think of lunch, now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You win,&#8221; laughed Brandon. &#8220;Your capacity
will make you famous some day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s made him famous already&mdash;at least, up
here,&#8221; Bob informed the radio inspector. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
you know that he is the undisputed champion pie
eater of the camp?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t know that, but it doesn&#8217;t surprise
me in the least to hear it,&#8221; said Brandon,
with a smile. &#8220;How did he gain his laurels?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Bob told him about the contest, and when
he had finished Mr. Brandon laughingly congratulated
Jimmy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I always had a sneaking idea that you could
do it,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;But after my experience
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
with lumbermen&#8217;s appetites, I realize that you
must have been on your mettle all the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was rather hard at the end,&#8221; admitted
Jimmy, &#8220;but take it all together it was a real
pleasure. That cook sure does know how to
make good pies,&#8221; and an expression of blissful
reminiscence spread over his round countenance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He made a regular pig of himself, but we
knew he would, and that&#8217;s why we had such confidence
in him,&#8221; said Joe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the kind!&#8221; protested Jimmy.
&#8220;You know you fellows got me into it in the first
place. You fixed it all up, and I only went in as
a favor to you. But I might know better than to
expect gratitude from this bunch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find it in the dictionary,&#8221; Joe informed
him. &#8220;You ought to be grateful to us for providing
you with a feed like that. It would have
cost you a lot of money to buy all those pies
back home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he came well out of it, at any rate,&#8221;
interposed the radio man. &#8220;But we must now be
getting somewhere near that cabin, and we&#8217;d better
go as quietly as we can. We know that there
are two of the gang hanging out in it, and there&#8217;s
no telling how many more there may be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so very near the cabin yet,&#8221; answered
Bob. &#8220;Nearer that tree to which they had the
receiving set attached.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, they advanced as silently as possible,
keeping a sharp lookout for any sign of the
black-moustached stranger and his friend. The
woods seemed devoid of human presence other
than their own, however, and they saw nothing
to arouse suspicion until at length they reached
the tree to which the receiving set was fastened.
Frank Brandon examined this with interest. The
box was securely locked, but the radio man drew
a big bunch of various-sized keys from his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see what&#8217;s in this box, but first I
think we&#8217;d better post sentries,&#8221; he said, in a low
voice. &#8220;Suppose you go back a few hundred feet
the way we came, Jimmy. You go the same distance
in the other direction, Herb. And Joe can
go a little way up the path that leads toward the
cabin. You can stay here and help me get this
box open, Bob. If any of you hear some one
coming, imitate a robin&#8217;s note three times, and
then keep out of sight. We don&#8217;t want the crooks
to suspect yet that anybody is on their trail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The three radio boys scattered to their appointed
posts, and Frank Brandon proceeded to
try key after key in the lock. He had to try fully
a dozen before at last the lock clicked and the door
of the box swung open.
</p>
<p>Inside was a complete radio receiving set, with
vacuum tube detector and batteries in perfect
working order. Between the roots of the tree an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
iron pipe had been driven into the earth to act as
a ground. The antenna was strung from top to
bottom of the tree on the side away from the
path, and there was nothing to differentiate the
box from an ordinary wire telephone set, except
that it was slightly larger. There were a number
of regular wire telephones scattered throughout
the woods, to aid in fighting forest fires, so that
anybody traveling along the path would have been
unlikely to give this outfit more than a passing
glance, if they noticed it at all. Had the radio
boys not chanced to see the black-moustached
man listening, with wireless headphones over his
ears, the fact that the box contained a wireless
receiving outfit might never have been discovered.
</p>
<p>Brandon and Bob went carefully over every article
of the equipment. They were on the lookout
for another notebook such as the boys had
found in the cabin, but there was nothing of the
kind in the box. When they were satisfied of this,
Mr. Brandon carefully replaced everything as he
had found it, and snapped the lock shut.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So much for that!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Now, let&#8217;s
get hold of the others and we&#8217;ll see what that
mysterious cabin looks like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joe and Herb and Jimmy were soon recalled
from their sentry duty, and all set out along the
path to the cabin. When they got close to the
clearing the three sentries were again posted,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
while Bob and the inspector made a detour
through the woods so as to approach the cabin on
the side away from the path, where there was
little likelihood of those inside keeping a lookout.
Very cautiously they advanced from the
concealment of the woods, Frank Brandon with
his right hand on the butt of a deadly looking
automatic pistol. They crept close to the wall of
the cabin, and listened intently for some sign of
life within.
</p>
<p>That there was at least one man in the cabin,
and that he was still sleeping, soon became evident,
for they heard the heavy breathing of one
sound asleep. Mr. Brandon cautiously raised
himself as high as the window, and peered within.
From this position he could not see the sleeper,
however, and he and Bob moved silently to the
other side of the shack. From there they commanded
a good view of the interior, and could
plainly see the sleeping man, who was the same
whom the boys had first encountered the day
before.
</p>
<p>His black-moustached face was toward them,
and Brandon gave a start of recognition, while
his fingers tightened on his pistol. For a few
moments he stood tense, evidently deciding what
to do. Then he beckoned to Bob to follow, and
made for the path where the others anxiously
awaited them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know that man in there!&#8221; exclaimed Brandon
excitedly. &#8220;He is known as &#8216;Black&#8217; Donegan,
on account of his black hair and moustache. He&#8217;s
wanted by the police of New York and Chicago,
and I guess other cities, too. We could easily get
him now, but if we did, the chances are the rest
of the gang would take alarm, and we&#8217;d miss the
chance of bagging them and getting back Mr.
Fennington&#8217;s stolen property. It&#8217;s hard to say
what is the best thing to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But on the instant a plan occurred to Bob, and
he lost no time in communicating it to the others.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>A NEFARIOUS PLOT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;If this fellow in the cabin is such a bad man,
we can&#8217;t afford to risk losing sight of him,&#8221; said
Bob. &#8220;Suppose Joe and Jimmy and I stay here,
while Herb goes back with you, Mr. Brandon.
We can stay here until your two regulars show up,
and Herb can then bring them here to relieve us.
How does that strike you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a way out of the predicament,&#8221; answered
Frank Brandon, his frown vanishing. &#8220;You fellows
are apt to have a long vigil, though. My
men won&#8217;t get to the camp until this afternoon,
and after that it takes quite a while to reach this
place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we can stand it,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
we, fellows?&#8221; he asked, glancing at the others.
</p>
<p>Both Joe and Jimmy agreed, although the latter
had secret misgivings as he thought regretfully
of the dinner he would miss. However, such considerations
were of little weight just then, and it
was finally decided to adopt Bob&#8217;s plan.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave my pistol with you,&#8221; said Brandon,
as he and Herb prepared to leave. &#8220;But whatever
else you do, steer clear of this gang and don&#8217;t use
firearms unless as a last resort. Remember, that
if they once find out their hiding place is discovered,
our whole scheme will be ruined.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys promised to exercise the greatest caution,
and then Mr. Brandon and Herb started
back toward camp.
</p>
<p>Bob, after a brief inspection, dropped the
deadly automatic pistol into his pocket, and then
the three friends considered how they might best
keep watch on the cabin without being discovered.
First of all, at Joe&#8217;s suggestion, they armed
themselves with serviceable clubs, that might come
in handy in time of necessity. Then they slipped
silently into the underbrush, and worked their
way along until they had attained a position where
they commanded a view of the cabin&#8217;s only door.
</p>
<p>The spot they had chosen was surrounded by
dense thickets, and one might have passed within
ten feet without spying them. Bob carefully
parted the bushes and broke off twigs here and
there until they could see plainly enough, and yet
were securely hidden from the cabin. This done,
the boys made themselves as comfortable as possible
under the circumstances, and prepared for
a long vigil.
</p>
<p>They had been in their retreat less than half an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
hour when the door of the shack was flung open,
and the black-moustached man appeared on the
threshold. He gazed searchingly about the little
clearing, then glanced up at the mounting sun and
stretched prodigiously. At length, apparently satisfied
that all was as it should be, he turned back
into the cabin, and soon the aroma of bacon and
coffee came floating down the wind to where the
boys lay. Jimmy&#8217;s nose twitched and his mouth
watered, but he thought of the importance of the
mission that had been intrusted to them by the
radio inspector and stifled his longings.
</p>
<p>The man in the cabin ate a leisurely breakfast,
and apparently was in no hurry. Indeed, from
the way he loitered over the meal, the boys rather
suspected that he was awaiting the arrival of some
other members of the gang. Nor were they mistaken.
After a time the lads could hear the
sound of approaching voices, and soon three men
entered the clearing and made for the cabin. At
the first sound of their voices, the man inside had
stepped swiftly to the door, one hand in the
bulging pocket of his coat; but when he recognized
the others an ugly grin spread over his face,
while his hand dropped to his side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you have got here at last, eh?&#8221; he snarled.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to find you didn&#8217;t hurry yourselves any.
I thought I sent you a wireless message to get
here early.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So you did, chief,&#8221; spoke up one of the newcomers.
&#8220;But we couldn&#8217;t get here no sooner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t?&#8221; snapped the other. &#8220;Why
couldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We got word that one of the government radio
inspectors was at the lumber camp, so we had to
come here by the long way. We were afraid he
might recognize one of us if we happened to bump
into him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the cops have photoed all of you so often
that I don&#8217;t wonder you&#8217;re shy,&#8221; sneered the
leader. &#8220;But come on inside. There&#8217;s no use of
standing chinning here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Two of the men muttered sullenly to themselves,
but ceased abruptly as the leader&#8217;s frowning
gaze fell on them. They all shuffled into the
cabin, and the black-moustached man shut the
door with a bang.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; whispered Bob, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got to listen in
on this pow-wow, fellows. I&#8217;m going to sneak
up to the window and try to hear what they&#8217;re
saying. They must have some purpose in meeting
here like this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, be mighty careful, Bob,&#8221; said Joe
anxiously. &#8220;They&#8217;re a tough crowd, and we&#8217;ve
got to watch our step. If they discover you, head
for here, and if we can&#8217;t get away we&#8217;ll put up a
battle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I have any kind of luck, they won&#8217;t discover
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
me,&#8221; Bob assured him. &#8220;Just sit tight, and
I&#8217;ll be back in a jiffy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Very cautiously he crept through the underbrush
toward the cabin. In spite of all his care
a branch snapped under him and the second time
the door was flung wide and the ill-favored leader
of the gang stepped out and peered about him.
</p>
<p>Bob flattened out as close to the ground as he
could get and lay tense, while the outlaw gazed
suspiciously at the bushes amid which he was concealed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Blackie?&#8221; called one of
the gang. &#8220;Did you think you heard somethin&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I did!&#8221; exclaimed the other. &#8220;But I
suppose it was only some animal prowling
around.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bein&#8217; alone in this shack has got on your
nerves, maybe,&#8221; taunted one of the gang.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nerves, my eye!&#8221; exclaimed the other. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t own such things! But I&#8217;ve got a notion to
take a look through those bushes, anyway,&#8221; and
he started in Bob&#8217;s direction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on back, Blackie,&#8221; urged another of the
gang. &#8220;We can&#8217;t be foolin&#8217; around here all day.
Be yourself, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others chimed in to the same effect, and
their leader reluctantly abandoned his search and
returned to the cabin. Had he gone another
twenty feet he would inevitably have discovered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
Bob, who had been on the point of springing to
his feet and giving battle. It was a narrow escape,
and the radio boys heaved sighs of relief as the
door of the cabin closed on the formidable figure
of the leader. They knew that these men were
desperate criminals, heavily armed, who would
not hesitate at murder to avoid capture.
</p>
<p>Bob resumed his advance, an inch at a time, and
at length reached the edge of the clearing. Before
him lay a stretch of perhaps twenty feet of open
ground, and should one of the desperados chance
to open the door while he was crossing this space,
discovery would be certain. However, this was
a chance that Bob knew he must take, and without
hesitation he sprang to his feet and ran swiftly
but silently toward the cabin.
</p>
<p>Fortunately he reached it unobserved, and
crouched close to the wall beneath one of the little
windows. There were numerous cracks in the
side of the rude structure, and he had no difficulty
in hearing what was going on inside.
</p>
<p>The crooks were engaged in a heated debate,
but soon the voice of their leader spoke out commandingly
and the others fell silent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you we haven&#8217;t had a chance to get rid
of that last load of silk we got near Castleton,&#8221; he
said, in an angry voice. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get the price I
wanted for it, and, besides, it will be just as easy
to get rid of two loads as one, and no more risk.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
Now, I&#8217;m going to send out a radio message in
code to the rest of the gang, and we&#8217;ll pull off the
job to-night, just as I&#8217;ve already told you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were no dissenting voices, and presently
Bob heard the whirr of the sending set, followed
by the voice of the leader.
</p>
<p>&#8220;HDEA&#8217; HDEA&#8217;,&#8221; he called again and again,
switching over to the receiving set to get an answer.
At length he evidently reached the station
he was after, for he listened intently for a few
minutes. Then the generator hummed again, and
Bob heard the black-moustached man speaking
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get this, and get it right,&#8221; he commanded,
and there followed a string of words that would
have been mere gibberish to Bob had he not held
the key to their meaning. He searched frantically
in his pockets for a pencil, and scribbled the words
down as the man spoke them. When he had finished,
the leader of the gang shut down the generator,
and turned to the others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fixed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There won&#8217;t be much
to do for the rest of the day but look over your
guns and make sure they&#8217;re in good working order.
Since we got that last truck they&#8217;ve been
putting guards on them, and we want to be prepared
to shoot before they do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a general pushing back of chairs,
and Bob realized that at any moment the door
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
might open. His mind worked quickly, and instead
of going back to his friends the way he had
come, he made a rush for the woods on the opposite
side of the clearing. In this way the &#8220;blind,&#8221;
or windowless, end of the cabin was toward him,
so that he would not be likely to be detected unless
the robbers came out and walked around the
house.
</p>
<p>Lucky it was for Bob that he acted as he did,
because he had barely started when the door was
flung open and those inside came streaming out.
For a few moments they stood in a group in
front of the door, talking, and then scattered, some
walking about, while others threw themselves on
the ground and smoked.
</p>
<p>But by this time Bob had reached the cover of
the woods undiscovered, and set out to rejoin
his friends. This necessitated a long detour, and
it was a full hour later that he crept silently into
their hiding place. So quietly did he come that
Jimmy was on the point of uttering a startled exclamation,
but checked himself just in time.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>PREPARING AN AMBUSH</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Say, you came as quietly as a shadow,&#8221; whispered
the plump youth. &#8220;How do you ever do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t expect me to blow a whistle under
the circumstances, do you?&#8221; asked Bob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that, but tell us what you heard,&#8221;
said Joe impatiently. &#8220;What are they up to,
Bob?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you until I compare what I copied
down with the code key,&#8221; said Bob, as he fished in
his pocket for the bit of paper on which he had
noted down the robber&#8217;s message. Having found
this, he and Joe searched through the key and
soon had the following message pieced together:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Truck&mdash;silk&mdash;Barberton Road&mdash;to-night.
Meet me and others&mdash;Hicks Bridge&mdash;eight
o&#8217;clock. Truck due&mdash;ten o&#8217;clock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Having deciphered the message, the boys gazed
questioningly at one another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t give us much time to act,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
Joe. &#8220;If we wait here it may be close to eight
o&#8217;clock before the others come to relieve us, and
then it will be too late to prevent the robbery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The answer is, that we won&#8217;t wait here,&#8221; said
Bob decisively. &#8220;As long as we know their plans
up until this evening, there&#8217;s no need of watching
this cabin any longer, anyway. We&#8217;d better start
back right away, and tell Mr. Brandon what we&#8217;ve
found out. He&#8217;ll know the best thing to do then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds all right to me,&#8221; said Joe, and as
Jimmy saw a chance of getting back to camp in
time for dinner, he put in no objections.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, for the love of butter, try to go quietly,
Jimmy,&#8221; warned Bob. &#8220;If those fellows hear a
sound from this direction, they&#8217;ll be right after us,
because their suspicions are already aroused.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do the best I can,&#8221; promised his rotund
friend. &#8220;But I&#8217;m heavier than you fellows, and I
can&#8217;t slide around so easily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, go easy, anyway,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Now,
are we all ready?&#8221;
</p>
<p>With infinite caution the boys wormed their
way through the brushwood, Bob leading. By
luck rather than good management Jimmy managed
to be as quiet as his friends, and after almost
an hour of this slow progress Bob judged that
they were far enough away from the cabin to risk
a faster pace. The shack was out of sight among
the trees when he sprang to his feet, followed by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
the others, and in a short time they had reached
the path leading to the main road. Here it was
still necessary to be extremely careful, for they
never knew at what moment some turn in the
path would bring them face to face with some of
the robber band. Fortunately nothing of the kind
happened, and soon they reached the main road
and started at high speed for camp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if we can&#8217;t take some sort of a short
cut,&#8221; came from Joe as they raced along.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk,&#8221; puffed poor Jimmy, who had
great difficulty in keeping up with his chums.
&#8220;The shorter the better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t dare risk it,&#8221; returned Bob. &#8220;Why
we might get lost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s afraid of getting lost?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are, for we might lose too much time and
all our plans would go to smash. No, we&#8217;ve got
to stick to the main road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much further have we to go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to chase along until we reach
camp,&#8221; put in Joe. &#8220;Hustle now, every minute
may be precious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t hustle any more than I am hustling,&#8221;
panted poor Jimmy. &#8220;Do you want me to drop
down of heart failure or something like that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;d better go along and leave Jimmy
behind,&#8221; suggested Joe, with a wink at Bob.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; cried the stout youth, and after
that did his best to keep up with the others.
</p>
<p>Not a great while later they came in sight of
camp, much to their relief.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brandon was astonished to see them back
so soon, but as briefly as possible Bob told him
of what they had learned and showed him the
code message.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows have done a clever bit of detective
work, and with reasonable luck it ought to be
possible to bag the whole gang to-night,&#8221; said
Brandon. &#8220;I know where Hicks Bridge is. It&#8217;s
about five miles this side of Barberton, and an
ideal place for an ambuscade. The road runs between
high banks just before it gets to the bridge,
and some of the gang posted on those banks could
command the road from either direction. But I&#8217;ll
get in communication with the chief of police of
Barberton, and we&#8217;ll see if we can&#8217;t catch the
thieves in their own trap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose the two men you were expecting
haven&#8217;t arrived yet, have they?&#8221; inquired Bob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. And I&#8217;m afraid we won&#8217;t be able to wait
for them, either,&#8221; said Brandon. &#8220;I could radio
to the Barberton chief, but I&#8217;m afraid the message
might be intercepted by the crooks, if one
of them happened to be listening. I guess it will
be better to go by way of my automobile, although
I hate to lose the time that it will take.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there a telephone line from the camp?&#8221;
suggested Joe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, unfortunately, one hasn&#8217;t been installed
yet,&#8221; replied the inspector. &#8220;But we can do the
trick with the car if we start right away. I suppose
there&#8217;s no need of asking if you fellows
would like to come with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None whatever,&#8221; answered Bob, grinning.
&#8220;Just give us a chance to go in and snatch a little
grub off the table, and we&#8217;ll eat it on the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Frank Brandon nodded, and the three boys
dashed into the mess hall and caught up anything
in the way of eatables that came nearest to hand,
Jimmy, of course, specializing on his favorite
doughnuts. Then they hurried out, and found
Mr. Brandon waiting for them, with the motor
running. After a short search they found Herb
fast asleep in his bunk, and roused him unceremoniously,
hustling him out before he was fairly
awake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it all about?&#8221; he questioned, rubbing
his eyes. &#8220;Has the camp caught fire, or do you
just want to borrow some money from me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind the funny business now, we&#8217;ll tell
you all about it while we&#8217;re traveling,&#8221; said Bob,
as they reached the automobile. &#8220;In you go,
Herb.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before they could find seats Mr. Brandon had
let in the clutch, and the car started with a jerk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
that landed them in a heap on the cushions. Regardless
of the rough road, he kept picking up
speed, and soon it was all they could do to stay in
the car at all. Barberton was about thirty miles
from the camp, and to reach it they had to cross
Hicks Bridge. All looked calm and peaceful just
then, and it was hard to believe that in a few short
hours a desperate fight might be raging between
the high banks that flanked the road. The bridge
was some two hundred feet long, and passed over
a deep cut between two hills. In spite of its present
peaceful appearance it was easy to see that
the place would be an ideal one to perpetrate such
a crime as the robbers contemplated, and after
they had passed over the bridge Mr. Brandon
opened the throttle wider in his impatience to
reach Barberton.
</p>
<p>They slowed down to go through the streets
of the town, and as they drew up in front of the
police station, Brandon shut off his motor and
leaped to the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on in, boys, and we&#8217;ll tell the chief about
the little party scheduled for this evening,&#8221; he
said, and the boys followed him into the police
station.
</p>
<p>Fortunately the chief of police, Mr. Durand,
was in, and he greeted Mr. Brandon with a heartiness
that showed they were old friends.
</p>
<p>After they had shaken hands, Brandon introduced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
the radio boys, and then proceeded to acquaint
the chief with the details of the plot they
had discovered. As Mr. Durand listened a dark
frown gathered between his bushy eyebrows, and
his fingers drummed angrily on the table before
him. When Mr. Brandon had finished, the chief
jumped to his feet and strode fiercely up and down
the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t be the first trouble we&#8217;ve had with
those rascals!&#8221; he exclaimed wrathfully. &#8220;Members
of the same gang have held up and robbed
stores in this town, and we have two of them
doing their bit in jail right now. And if we have
any luck to-night we&#8217;ll have the whole gang under
lock and key before the morning. These young
fellows must have been right on the job from start
to finish, Frank.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess they were,&#8221; replied Brandon.
&#8220;If we land this gang, we&#8217;ll have them to thank
for it. But now what are your plans for capturing
the crooks?&#8221;
</p>
<p>For answer the chief pressed a button, and a
capable looking police lieutenant appeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get together ten of our best men,&#8221; he directed,
&#8220;and put them into two automobiles.
When they are ready to start, report to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lieutenant saluted, and left the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the code message, the robbers
won&#8217;t be at Hicks Bridge much before eight
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
o&#8217;clock, which is after dark these days,&#8221; said the
chief. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get there a lot earlier than that,
and I&#8217;ll conceal my men in the woods. Then I&#8217;ll
leave orders here to stop the motor truck as it
comes through, and replace its crew with a few
picked men from my force. When the robbers
try to hold up that truck, they&#8217;ll have a big surprise
in store for them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be a good plan,&#8221; suggested Bob, &#8220;to
mount a searchlight or two on the motor truck.
At the right minute you could turn these on the
crooks, and while it would confuse them, it would
give your men in the woods a big advantage, as
they&#8217;d be able to see the hold-up men plainly without
being seen themselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young man, that&#8217;s a first-rate suggestion!&#8221;
exclaimed the chief, eyeing him appraisingly,
&#8220;and you can believe we&#8217;ll take advantage of it.
I&#8217;ll commandeer a couple from the Electric Light
Company in readiness to mount on the truck when
it comes along. I wish we could persuade you
and your friends to join the Barberton police
force.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be pretty nearly a part of it until those
crooks are captured, if you&#8217;ll let us,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;We all want to be in at the finish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a dangerous business, and bullets
may fly thick,&#8221; the chief warned him. &#8220;You fellows
have done more than your full duty already,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
and we can hardly call on you to do any more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same, we&#8217;ll come along if you don&#8217;t
mind,&#8221; insisted Bob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll be very glad to have you, as far as I&#8217;m
concerned,&#8221; said Mr. Durand. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll
want to be in on it, too, Frank?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re dead right,&#8221; Brandon assured him emphatically.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone too far with this to want
to drop out now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this point the lieutenant appeared and reported
that the men were in the automobiles,
ready to start. Picking up the telephone, the chief
ordered his own car. He invited Mr. Brandon
and the radio boys to ride with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can leave your car in the police garage,
Frank,&#8221; he said, and Brandon was not slow in
availing himself of this offer. In a short time
he returned, and the three automobiles started for
the scene of the projected hold-up, the chief&#8217;s car
leading and the other two following close behind.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>LYING IN WAIT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t look as though there&#8217;s going to be
much monotony in our young lives to-night,&#8221; remarked
Bob, as, tightly packed in the tonneau of
the car, the boys rode on through the gathering
darkness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For that matter there hasn&#8217;t been much for
several days past,&#8221; chuckled Joe, who sat at his
right. &#8220;A fellow would have to be a glutton to
want more adventure than we&#8217;ve had since we
came to Braxton Woods. What with Buck
Looker and Black Donegan, we ought to be pretty
well satisfied.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only hope Cassey will be in the gang that
is rounded up to-night,&#8221; observed Herb. &#8220;It
would be too bad if only the rest were captured
and that all-around scoundrel slipped through the
meshes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess Cassey is the brains of the whole
bunch,&#8221; put in Jimmy. &#8220;Probably the others
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
didn&#8217;t know anything about radio until he put
them on to it. He&#8217;ll be there all right. And he&#8217;s
likely to put up a pretty stiff fight before he lets
himself be captured, for he knows what it means
to him to be sent back to prison. With a new
sentence tacked on to the old one it&#8217;ll probably
mean that he&#8217;ll be in for life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a little while they reached the scene of the
proposed robbery. They were well in advance of
the time set by the plotters, and the chief took his
time in carefully disposing his forces, availing
himself of Frank Brandon&#8217;s advice in doing
this.
</p>
<p>The bridge stretched between two hills at the
bottom of which was a small stream, about a
hundred feet below. On each side, almost down
to the bridge itself, extended trees and shrubbery
that afforded excellent hiding places. The only
trouble was that both the outlaws and the officers
who were trying to apprehend them were likely to
seek the same shelter and might in this way stumble
across each other before the trap was ready to
be sprung.
</p>
<p>This, however, was a contingency that had to
be faced, and preparations were made accordingly.
The men were placed at strategic points on both
sides of the bridge. Whether the attempt at hold-up
would be made at the entrance to the bridge or
on the further side was a matter of speculation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
The chief went on the theory, however, that it
would probably take place at the entrance, and
there he placed the majority of the men under
him.
</p>
<p>The radio boys hinted that there was where
they would like to be also, but in this the chief
was adamant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve stretched a point in letting you young fire-eaters
come along at all,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As it is, I
may have a hard time explaining to your parents.
And I hate to think what my position would be if
anything happened to you. So I am going to
put you where I think you&#8217;ll be comparatively out
of danger. You&#8217;re just to be lookers on at this
shindig. And if the bullets begin to fly, you just
lie flat on the ground behind the trees until they
stop. It may not be so glorious, but it&#8217;s likely to
be a mighty sight more healthy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So, much against their will, the boys were compelled
to obey orders and take the place assigned
to them which was on the further side of the
bridge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Putting us up in the gallery when we ought to
have seats in the orchestra,&#8221; grumbled Joe, as the
boys ensconced themselves in a thicket behind a
big clump of trees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheer up, you old gloom hound,&#8221; chaffed Bob.
&#8220;We may get in on this yet. At any rate, if we
are in the gallery, we have a good view of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
stage. Or at least we shall have, when the searchlight
gets busy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The darkness deepened until the night became
as black as Egypt. There was no moon, and even
the stars were obscured by clouds that heavily
veiled the sky. The night was chill, and the boys
buttoned their coats tightly about them as they
sat waiting for developments.
</p>
<p>They had perhaps an hour to wait, but it was
not known but that some of the robbers would be
on the ground at an earlier time than had been set,
and every sense was on the alert as all strained
their ears for the slightest sound and peered into
the darkness on the chance that they might catch
glimpses of shadowy forms. After the first few
moments they had not ventured to talk for fear
that they might be overheard. But this did not
debar them from thinking, and they thrilled with
excitement as they pictured each to himself the
struggle that seemed about to take place on the
road.
</p>
<p>The minutes dragged along interminably, and
in the intense silence the lads could almost hear
the beating of their hearts. Then at a little distance
a twig cracked and sent the blood racing
madly through their veins.
</p>
<p>Soon footsteps were heard approaching, and
the lads crouched still lower in their hiding place.
The sounds came nearer, and they could detect the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
tread of two men. They were approaching without
any excessive degree of caution, as they had
no reason to believe that their plans had been discovered.
As they drew closer, the boys could
hear them conversing in low tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said a rough voice,
which they recognized as that of Black Donegan.
&#8220;All the fellows are tipped off and know just
what they&#8217;ve got to do. Jake and Toppy will do
the holding up, and then the rest of us will jump
in if the driver cuts up rough. If he does, there&#8217;ll
be one more dead driver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys waited for the answer that seemed to
be long in coming. What they heard finally was
a whistle that made them jump. They had heard
that whistle before!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cassey!&#8221; whispered Bob to Joe. &#8220;Cassey, as
sure as you&#8217;re born!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next instant his belief became a thrilling
certainty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It-t-t-t isn&#8217;t the d-d-driver.&#8221; The voice came
out, with an explosive quality. &#8220;It&#8217;s the g-g-guards
he may have w-w-with him. The p-p-police
are getting pretty l-l-leary about all the robberies
t-t-t-that have been taking place around
here lately, and they&#8217;ve g-g-g-,&#8221; again came the
whistle, &#8220;g-got to do something or lose their jobs.
At any rate t-t-this is the last thing we&#8217;re g-g-going
to pull off around here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;s right about that,&#8221; Joe whispered
to Bob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;and j-j-just as soon as we&#8217;re through
with this, w-w-we&#8217;d better p-pull up stakes and
try somewhere else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The voice was now so close at hand that if the
boys had reached out of the thicket they would
almost have touched the speaker. At this thought
Jimmy and Herb, especially, felt a thrill of excitement.

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>AN EXCITING STRUGGLE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I think myself that we&#8217;ve hung round this
neck o&#8217; the woods about long enough,&#8221; agreed
Donegan. &#8220;And I ain&#8217;t any too well pleased to
have that radio inspector snooping around the
woods. He ain&#8217;t up to any good if you ask me.
But brace up, Cassey, for this last haul. You ain&#8217;t
generally chicken-hearted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll f-f-find that I have my n-n-nerve with
me when the pinch comes,&#8221; replied Cassey. &#8220;I&#8217;d
rather be k-k-killed by a bullet than g-g-g-go back
to prison.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The voices receded as the men went on, and
soon the sound of their footsteps ceased. It was
evident they were searching for the most advantageous
place for the crime that they contemplated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you that I had a hunch that that villain
would be here,&#8221; whispered Jimmy, when they felt
that it would be safe to speak.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good thing, too,&#8221; said Bob grimly. &#8220;Cassey&#8217;ll
get to-night what&#8217;s coming to him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>Half an hour passed&mdash;an hour&mdash;an hour and a
half. Then far in the distance the boys heard the
hum of a motor engine and the rumble of a heavy
truck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There it comes!&#8221; ejaculated Joe, throwing
caution to the winds in his excitement.
</p>
<p>The rumbling grew louder, and soon the boys
knew that it must be close to the bridge. Then
they saw the lamps of an auto truck sending out
their beams of light a hundred feet in advance,
and could just discern above them the massive
body of the truck.
</p>
<p>It came on at a moderate rate of speed, slowing
up somewhat as it struck the bridge.
</p>
<p>Suddenly shots rang out and the boys could
see two dark figures standing on the bridge and
waving their hands at the driver, as they bellowed
out orders to stop. At the same time, as
though the shots had been a signal, three other
figures came rushing from other directions.
</p>
<p>It was impossible for the boys to keep still, and
they too sprang to their feet and started for the
scene of the hold-up, running at the top of their
speed.
</p>
<p>Just as they left their covert there was a blinding
flash that made the whole bridge as bright as
day. A searchlight had been turned on from the
top of the truck full in the faces of the robbers.
They staggered as though they had been struck,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
and at the same instant there came a volley of
shots and the police were upon the hold-up
men.
</p>
<p>There was a wild mélée of struggling men, as
they swayed back and forth in a desperate struggle.
The robbers had been taken completely by
surprise and were outnumbered two to one.
There were shouts and the crack of revolvers, and
the thud of pistol butts.
</p>
<p>But the battle, though fierce, was of short duration.
In a few minutes the robbers had been subdued.
One lay stunned on the bridge and another
lay by him wounded. Two more were held in the
grasp of officers.
</p>
<p>One, however, tore himself away from the officer
who had grappled with him, and came rushing
in the direction of the radio boys. In the
glare from the searchlight they recognized Cassey.
</p>
<p>He saw them, too, and fired his revolver at
them. The shot went wild. He pressed the
trigger again but with no result. Then, realizing
that his weapon was empty, he hurled it at Bob,
who was nearest to him.
</p>
<p>Bob dodged, and the next instant grabbed at
Cassey&#8217;s legs. The expertness that had made
him the star of his football team stood him in good
stead. His arms closed round Cassey in a flying
tackle, and they came heavily to the bridge
together.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>Cassey struggled desperately to rise, but Bob
held him in an unbreakable grip, and a second
later his comrades had come to his assistance and
the scoundrel was overpowered and delivered over
to the police, who came rushing up.
</p>
<p>The robbers were securely bound and bundled
into the auto truck that they had planned to rob.
Then in high spirits the party drove back to Barberton.
The chief was jubilant, and the praises
he heaped upon the radio boys made their ears
burn. They stayed long enough at his office to
see the prisoners safely jailed and then, though
the hour was late, rode back to their quarters in
the woods with Mr. Brandon.
</p>
<p>They slept long and late after their exciting
experience, and it was almost noon the next day
when they awoke. Bob was somewhat surprised
to find a letter waiting for him. It bore no stamp,
and had evidently been brought there by one of the
lumbermen.
</p>
<p>He opened it curiously and glanced at the signature.
Then he gave a shout that brought his
comrades quickly to his side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of this, fellows?&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Buck Looker&#8217;s writing to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a chorus of wondering exclamations.
</p>
<p>The last paragraph caught Bob&#8217;s eye and he
read it aloud:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As for Bob Layton and those other chumps,
all we&#8217;ve got to do is to stand pat. No one saw
us put the stones in the snowballs, and if we just
deny it, they can&#8217;t pin anything on us. They&#8217;ll
have to pay for the window, and that&#8217;ll even up
things for what they did to us at Mountain Pass.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;Yours,</p>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Buck.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Bob was utterly dumbfounded. Then he
glanced at the heading of the letter and let out a
whoop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this is too rich!&#8221; he cried, almost choking
with laughter. &#8220;This letter is directed to Carl
Lutz. You know he went home two or three days
ago. Buck has written two letters, one to Lutz
and the other to me&mdash;probably a roast&mdash;and he&#8217;s
put them in the wrong envelopes. Oh, how he&#8217;s
given himself away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s comrades were fairly convulsed, and
Jimmy grew so purple in the face that they had
to slap him vigorously on the back. They had
scarcely got him into a calmer frame, before he
threatened to go off again, for he saw Buck
Looker strolling along the road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably&#8217;s come along to see how you were
bearing up under the roast,&#8221; chuckled Joe.
</p>
<p>Bob ran over toward Buck, followed by his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
comrades. Buck looked alarmed and put himself
in a posture of defense.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re not going to hurt you,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;I only wanted to tell you that I got your letter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it blistered your hide,&#8221; growled Buck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It made me nearly laugh myself to death,&#8221; replied
Bob. &#8220;But let me advise you, Buck, to
make sure the next time that you get the right
letter in the right envelope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; asked Buck, in
apprehension.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only that I got the letter you meant for Carl
Lutz,&#8221; replied Bob. &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ve forgotten
what you said, so I&#8217;ll read the last paragraph,&#8221;
and, dwelling on every word, he read it over deliberately.
</p>
<p>Before he had quite finished, Buck made a
desperate grab at the letter, but Bob was too
quick for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t!&#8221; he exclaimed, as he folded it
and put it carefully into his pocket. &#8220;That letter&#8217;s
going to cost you about two hundred dollars, for
that&#8217;s what it will cost to pony up for the broken
window. We&#8217;ve got you dead to rights, and you&#8217;d
better pay up and pay up quick. So long, Buck.
And do be more careful next time to get the right
letter in the right envelope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With all his bluster knocked out of him, Buck
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
slunk away. The boys were not surprised to
learn in the next letter from home that the insurance
company had been paid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some excitement we have had here,&#8221; remarked
Bob. &#8220;Wonder if we&#8217;ll ever have such
strenuous times again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; declared Joe promptly, and he was
right, as we shall see in the next volume of this
series, to be called, &#8220;The Radio Boys with the
Forest Rangers.&#8221; In that volume we shall see
how they fought a fire that came close to ending
tragically.
</p>
<p>After a good dinner, the boys lay sprawled out
on the grass basking in the spring sunshine and
utterly at peace with themselves and the world.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s been hard work, but we&#8217;ve had
pretty good luck at trailing a voice,&#8221; observed
Bob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Joe with a grin, &#8220;and s-s-s-such
a v-v-v-voice!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Jimmy whistled.

never was there a better crowd of lads to associate with than
the students of the School. All boys will read these stories
with deep interest. The rivalry between the towns along the

track athletics, and at ice hockey, were without number.
Any lad reading one volume of this series will surely want

of city affairs, life in the Wild West, among the cowboys
and Indians, thrilling rescues along the seacoast, the daring of
picture hunters in the jungle among savage beasts, and the
great risks run in picturing conditions in a land of earthquakes.
The volumes teem with adventures and will be found
interesting from first chapter to last.

<p style=' font-size:1.4em;'>The Railroad Series</p>
<p>By ALLEN CHAPMAN</p>
<p>Author of the Radio Boys, Etc.</p>
<p>Illustrated. Handsomely Bound in Cloth.</p>
<p>Every Volume Complete in Itself.</p>
</div>

<p>In this line of books there is revealed the whole workings of a great
American railroad system. There are adventures in abundance&mdash;railroad
wrecks, dashes through forest fires, the pursuit of a &#8220;wildcat&#8221;
locomotive, the disappearance of a pay car with a large sum of money on
board&mdash;but there is much more than this&mdash;the intense rivalry among
railroads and railroad men, the working out of running schedules, the
getting through &#8220;on time&#8221; in spite of all obstacles, and the manipulation
of railroad securities by evil men who wish to rule or ruin.
